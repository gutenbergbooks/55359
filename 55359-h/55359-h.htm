<h1 title="">THE MYSTERY CRASH</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE DESERTED AIRPLANE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;See that! Look! There&rsquo;s our mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob Wright pointed from the cabin window
of the monoplane. Al, his younger brother,
peered toward the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Where? Show me any mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make himself understood above the roar
of the engine, Bob put his lips close to Al&rsquo;s ear
while Curt, Bob&rsquo;s closest friend, also a passenger,
bent close to catch his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mystery all right&mdash;but you can&rsquo;t see
from here. It was in that cornfield we passed
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the mystery?&rdquo; Curtis Brown&rsquo;s eyes
snapped with eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you say &lsquo;our&rsquo; mystery?&rdquo; Al asked
at the same instant. Bob answered both at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery is: Why is an airplane hidden
in the grove at the edge of a cornfield? Our
mystery because we discovered it and because,
ever since we helped father solve his detective
cases and took an interest in aviation we have
wanted to solve something that connects up puzzles
and &rsquo;planes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A &lsquo;crate&rsquo;?&rdquo; Al stared out. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;
Bob was not there to reply. He moved up to
the pilot, Langley Wright, his cousin, who was
test pilot for the Tredway Aircraft Corporation
and who was giving this beautiful &ldquo;job&rdquo; its
final test and check flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lang,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I saw an airplane in the
grove at the edge of that last field we crossed.
Circle back, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; As Lang turned from
jotting down some data, Bob added: &ldquo;The ship
hasn&rsquo;t crashed. It&rsquo;s in among the trees&mdash;backed
in. I caught a glimpse of it, and then the trees
hid it. I&rsquo;d like to have another look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lang, twenty-one and an expert flyer, grinned
at his sixteen-year-old cousin, dipped ailerons,
kicked rudder and with a good &ldquo;bank&rdquo; as the
craft swung its nose around, he deftly counteracted
a tendency of the ship to go into a sideslip,
jotted down some information on his data
board and then looked out of his window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the field,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a
crate there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I told Al and Curt it&rsquo;s a mystery,&rdquo;
Bob replied. &ldquo;The ship has been hidden!
Its tail is in between trees, and the wings are
under trees with high branches. I don&rsquo;t believe
it could be seen from the highway that runs by
the field. I know it wouldn&rsquo;t be noticed from
the air, except by chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m!&rdquo; grunted Langley, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of
hidden treasure, but this is the first hidden
&rsquo;plane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Bob pointed past Lang&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; Lang continued to circle, in order
to get another sight of the mysteriously hidden
ship. As they came around again Al and Curt
located it also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s staked down!&rdquo; Al, although he was the
youngest, not much past thirteen, had the quickest
eyes of the group. &ldquo;I saw the stakes, and
rope over the wing-tips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The engine was covered over,&rdquo; added Curt.</p>
<p>Lang spiraled down to pass as close as the
trees would allow.</p>
<p>They saw nothing more, however, and after
Lang had refused Al&rsquo;s impulsive request to &ldquo;set
down&rdquo; in the small field, the party flew on to
the landing field of the Aircraft Corporation
where Lang had some alterations to report in
the adjustment of the ship&rsquo;s balance before it
could be delivered to its purchaser.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get our bicycles and ride out to the
field,&rdquo; urged Al, as the trio of comrades alighted
beyond the aircraft plant.</p>
<p>They pedaled the three miles in record time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was right,&rdquo; commented Bob, as they left
the wheels beside the highway and climbed over
the high rail fence enclosing the stubble where
corn had recently been cut down. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
see the airplane from any place along the highway&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; interrupted Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Curt was a little ahead. He waved
his arm. &ldquo;There she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crossed the rough field, toward the mysterious,
silent object of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see from here it hasn&rsquo;t cracked up,&rdquo;
Curt declared. &ldquo;Not a scratch on it and the
landing gear is perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever flew it must be clever,&rdquo; declared
Bob. &ldquo;Look at the narrow strip of open, smooth
ground he had to &lsquo;set down&rsquo; on. If he hadn&rsquo;t
been able to shoot the field so as to get in on
that long, smooth side, with only a few feet
clearance, he&rsquo;d have come down in rough
stubble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he must have been good,&rdquo; agreed Al.
&ldquo;And it proves that he was forced down. Any
sane pilot would have gone on to a better spot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>They reached the airplane, a two-winged
model with a radial motor and small wings; it
was a speed ship, trim and mystifying with its
dark, brown body and airfoils freshly done.</p>
<p>Curtis, whose age was midway between Al&rsquo;s
thirteen and Bob&rsquo;s sixteen, clambered onto a
landing wheel and observed the instruments on
the dash. &ldquo;Plenty of gas, and oil,&rdquo; he remarked.
Then his companions saw his face change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; As he called he leaped from his
perch so that Bob could occupy it; Al was up
on the other side, and it took no explaining to
show what had caused Curt&rsquo;s exclamation. Both
youths saw the small square of paper pinned to
the folded parachute on the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare we look?&rdquo; questioned Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can read it from here,&rdquo; Al said, and reported.
&ldquo;It says, &lsquo;Everything O.K.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crickety Christmas!&rdquo; Curt resorted to his
favorite expression. &ldquo;&lsquo;Everything O.K.&rsquo; Then
it wasn&rsquo;t a forced landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Bob. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem like one,
somehow. The ship is too carefully tucked away.
And, now&mdash;this note. Who is it to? Who put it
there? Does it mean the ship is all right&mdash;or
something else? I was right when I said&mdash;&lsquo;there&rsquo;s
our mystery.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were!&rdquo; admitted Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do about it?&rdquo; objected Al.
&ldquo;Take turns watching? Wait to see who comes
back, and what he does?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; counseled Curt. &ldquo;It may be a
mystery why the crate is here, and all that!
But it isn&rsquo;t any of our business&mdash;is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Bob. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home, and
see what father thinks of it. There is probably
some easy explanation we haven&rsquo;t thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We can ride out here first thing&mdash;early&mdash;tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could not consult the private detective
whose success had been so pronounced that
cases came to him from distant cities: he was
out of town that night.</p>
<p>When they rode out to the field the next day,
at sunrise, looking for the mysteriously deserted
airplane it was gone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your mystery now?&rdquo; Curt was inclined
to poke a little fun at Bob. &ldquo;As the
sleight-of-hand performers say, &lsquo;Now you see
it, now you don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Al who was poking about in the
grass under the trees, bent and then exhibited
a damp, crumpled paper, &ldquo;here is the note. Now,
what do you say if we have a session of the old
Master Sleuths, and see what we can deduce
from this paper?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>A year before, asked to do a little investigating
for Mr. Wright, when he was handling a
case where youths would be least likely to
arouse suspicion by shadowing, the trio had become
intensely interested in detective work and
had termed themselves the Master Sleuths,
more in fun than in earnest. However, when
they had become &ldquo;air minded&rdquo; the term had been
dropped. Al, reviving it, won a grin from Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Bob agreed. &ldquo;The paper is damp.
It has been out in the dew. Under the trees it
would take a good while for it to get as soggy
as it is. The writing has smudged&mdash;it&rsquo;s sort of
purple&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was written with an indelible pencil,&rdquo; remarked
Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all we have to do is to find a man with
an&mdash;&rdquo; Al was not allowed to finish. Bob broke
in, as older brothers like to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;get &lsquo;the man in the gray suit!&rsquo; How
many indelible pencils do you suppose there are
in this country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Al took the matter good-humoredly.
&ldquo;Anyhow, if a man wrote it and a man
read it and threw it away&mdash;two hands have
handled it.&rdquo; He put it carefully in his pocket.
&ldquo;There may be fingerprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good will they do?&rdquo; asked Curt. &ldquo;The
mystery is all done with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Bob, holding up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From above came the drone of an airplane
engine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">AT ROCKY LAKE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I hear it!&rdquo; exclaimed Al. He ran out onto
the turf that had been used as a runway, probably,
when the airplane took off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Curt, following him. &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t locate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, craning his neck, staring up toward the
great banks of clouds which the early sun was
painting with rosy fire, looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we ought not
to hear it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be too far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; Al was incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy! Lang came home a little before daybreak.
He had been at the airplane plant all
night, with the &lsquo;mechs&rsquo; because Mr. Tredway
wanted to get that Silver Flash ready for delivery
in a rush. I didn&rsquo;t go to sleep again.
I got up, and dressed and went out to tighten
the handlebar on my bicycle. I glanced up, just
as day broke, at the little windsock I have on
our roof.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wind was directly <i>West</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo; began Al; but Curt, wetting
the back of his hand, tested the air in various
directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You use your head, Bob,&rdquo; he said admiringly.
&ldquo;The breeze is pretty strong, and it has
shifted around <i>to South</i>, straight from the
Equator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you two trying to be mysterious?&rdquo; Al
was a little bit annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you wanted to be a Master Sleuth,
last year,&rdquo; remarked Curt. &ldquo;Use your eyes and
your brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-m-m&mdash;the airplane must be gone a long
time because the wind was West and now it&rsquo;s
South&mdash;um-m-m. Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah-ha!&rsquo; cried Shawkhaw,&rdquo; Bob mocked,
twisting the famous Hawkshaw title as he made
fun of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This turf runs East and West.&rdquo; Al ignored
Bob&rsquo;s mockery. &ldquo;That biplane was a speed
model and it would have to get up higher speed
than the average to take off. The runway is
too short to give it a good run, so it couldn&rsquo;t
very well have hopped off in time to get over
the trees unless it took full advantage of the
wind! Isn&rsquo;t that it, Bob?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. The wind changed about the time
we left our meeting point with Curt. So that
airplane ought to be well on its way, wherever
its way leads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this engine is getting louder,&rdquo; stated
Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; cried Al, pointing toward the
South. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a speck. But you see it, don&rsquo;t
you, Curt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if it is spiraling down&mdash;yes, it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t the biplane we saw here, at all,&rdquo;
Bob said. &ldquo;Curt, do you know what?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s the very &rsquo;plane we were in yesterday,
with Lang. He gave it a final check-up
and said if they worked on it all night it would
be ready to take off today. That&rsquo;s it, all righty!
The biplane was brown, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Silver Flash! I can see it glisten
against that dark cloud,&rdquo; added Al. &ldquo;I think
it&rsquo;s coming down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s diving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of control! It&rsquo;s
falling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right over Rocky Lake!&rdquo; shouted Curt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; urged Al, scrambling over the
short stubble in the field, in haste to reach his
bicycle and pedal toward the picnic grounds,
less than a quarter of a mile away, in which
Rocky Lake was situated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; counseled Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Come on!&rdquo; Curt agreed with Al. The
airplane was out of control. It was diving,
straight toward the amusement ground around
the lake. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a crack-up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind the trees, out of sight, like a silver
streak, a comet, the airplane fell. Three hearts
went cold as the ship was lost to view behind
the foliage. While they could not see the craft
strike, any spot in Rocky Lake Park was bad
for a landing: dense trees, whole groves, alternated
with stands, pavilions, and the deep,
boulder-studded water of Rocky Lake and the
rivulet which fed it.</p>
<p>Three minds worked as one, three pairs of
legs tumbled their owners over the stile, onto
the roadside turf, up to the bicycles.</p>
<p>Pedaling like madmen they made short time
of the trip to the edge of the amusement spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was directly over Rocky Lake!&rdquo;
Curt, in the lead, called over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Dropping their wheels by the roadside they
ran, winded but determined, towards the picnic
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there&mdash;in the lake!&rdquo; gasped Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It crashed, all right!&rdquo; panted Curt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half buried in the water.&rdquo; Al puffed
along a little to the rear. &ldquo;I hope the pilot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Lang, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Bob responded to Curt&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;It
must have been some other pilot&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think
who, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; urged Al. &ldquo;Hello&mdash;hello!&rdquo; he called,
passing the pavilions. &ldquo;Is anybody around!
Wake up&mdash;somebody! Help! Help! A &rsquo;plane
has cracked up in Rocky Lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything of the pilot?&rdquo; Bob turned to
Curt. Gasping for breath they had reached the
shore of the lake, by a small wharf where rowboats
were hired during the day.</p>
<p>Curt scanned the surface of the lake.</p>
<p>Quite near the shore, and on the rocks, with
one crumpled wing, and with her nose and cabin
buried in soft, oozey mud, the smashed monoplane
lay with its pitifully useless tail assembly
sticking up into the air. The &ldquo;flippers&rdquo; had carried
way with the impact and hung by the control
cables.</p>
<p>Bob turned a serious face toward his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope&mdash;I wonder&rdquo;&mdash; He could not finish.
The thought flitted through his mind that unless
the pilot had been extremely quick and very
clever, he could not have gotten out of the cabin&mdash;in
time. The falling craft had been close
enough so that had any figure leaped, especially
with a parachute, they should have seen it
clearly.</p>
<p>No such figure had leaped&mdash;in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&mdash;crawled out when it struck,&rdquo; said
Curt, hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, let&rsquo;s get a boat, and try to get
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al,&rdquo; called Curt, &ldquo;stop calling for help!
There isn&rsquo;t anybody here. Run to the farmhouse
across the road&mdash;no, that&rsquo;s empty. Ride
back down the road, till you see an automobile
and send it to town for help. If you don&rsquo;t meet
one, stop at the first house and telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al, for all his natural eagerness to be at the
scene, to share in their experiences, saluted
without a word of remonstrance and hurried
away. Meanwhile Bob, realizing that the oars
for the boats were locked in the small pavilion
on the wharf, determined to break in, feeling
that the emergency removed any taint of robbery
or pillage from the act.</p>
<p>Fortunately he found the old, rusted lock not
caught. He slipped the rusty padlock, slipped
the hasp free, and ran back to the dock where
Curt had a boat untied and ready. In this, pushing
off, they rowed out to the airplane. The
weight of its engine was very slowly driving
its nose deeper into the soft ooze of the marshy
ground at that end of the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; begged Curt, as Bob bent to his
task.</p>
<p>Suddenly Bob rested on his oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Curt, and as he
saw the expression of Bob&rsquo;s face he, too, became
intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; panted Bob. &ldquo;A call&mdash;a
call for help?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But row!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob rowed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">A GREATER MYSTERY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There comes the call again!&rdquo; whispered
Curt. &ldquo;It was &lsquo;help!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob sent the boat through the mirrorlike
water. He headed for the immersed nose of the
airplane and as they rounded the cabin, part
of it sticking up forlornly, Curt lifted a hand
to point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There is the parachute, partly inflated,
floating on the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as though the pilot tried to get out
of the cabin, and either pulled his ripcord too
soon, or else some part of the harness caught
and held him&mdash;until too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sobered and worried, wondering just what to
do and who had called, they sent their eyes
questing here and there&mdash;into as much of the
cabin as they could see from the window just
under the transparent surface of Rocky Lake,
but without result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he might be caught in the cabin,&rdquo;
said Bob. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see any&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;There he is&mdash;see! Out on the lake!&rdquo; Curt
pointed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob pushed away from the fuselage of the
sinking craft, and with a sweep brought the
bow of their boat around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he caught sight of a head bobbing in
the water, &ldquo;oh, Curt&mdash;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rowing hard, he sent the boat toward the
swimmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo; Curt&rsquo;s voice was relieved. &ldquo;The
pilot escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be the pilot, Curt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been swimming toward the &rsquo;plane,
from out in the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Bob, but he may have seen us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;d have part of the parachute harness
on,&rdquo; Bob objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he slashed it off. Maybe he saw
it was too late to get out, that the &rsquo;chute was
too low, and he slashed himself free and started
to swim across the water&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;d have come to this closer shore,
and landed on the wharf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched the man, treading water as he
saw them coming.</p>
<p>Across the water a call floated clearly to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear&mdash;a call&mdash;for help?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we did,&rdquo; Bob called back, and,
as they came closer the man spoke less loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you aren&rsquo;t the pilot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Curt commented when the man
failed to reply, being busy clearing water from
his eyes to look around the lake again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen anybody at all,&rdquo; the man spoke
as he caught the gunwale and pulled himself
up and into the boat with Curt&rsquo;s aid. &ldquo;Heard
a shout, though. Row back boys, to that thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went back over the course. The
stranger, studying the aircraft, seemed very
much disturbed and worried. He had a hand
ready to catch the struts of a wing as they
swung under the tilted airfoil: while Bob stowed
the needless oar on that side he drew the boat
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see anything in the cabin. We
looked, before,&rdquo; Bob explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Untie that painter,&rdquo; the stranger ordered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down under the nose, and the mud
might hold me&mdash;so, if I signal, you pull.&rdquo; As
Curt unknotted the tying rope and threw it to
him, the man looped an end under his arms,
knotting it swiftly, flung the short coil to Bob
and lowered himself, disappearing into the
water, his descent stirred up mud, moiling the
water. Down he went, hidden almost at once
in the murky disturbance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Paying out the rope until it grew slack, Bob
took a turn around a rowlock, and they waited
breathlessly. Some bubbles floated up and broke.
Then came a tug on the rope.</p>
<p>Curt, who had already come to the midships
section, helped Bob tug and haul in the wet
manilla strands. The stranger came up through
the murky water, emerged, shook himself free
of the liquid, caught the boat and shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the cabin&mdash;only thing I can think of
is&mdash;if he tried to jump and got under the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very soberly the youths helped him back into
the boat.</p>
<p>People were arriving on the bank, shouting
to one another, calling for information, shipping
oars in boats. Al, having met several
motorists, had spread the alarm, and then had
ridden on to telephone the police and to report
the crash.</p>
<p>Al, having returned, was in the second boat
to arrive by the slowly sinking craft.</p>
<p>Bob gave him a concise report while they
pushed away from the place to enable a deputy
sheriff to take command and to jot down the
stranger&rsquo;s explanation and their own, from
Curt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you boys would row me across the
little bayou, here,&rdquo; the man said. Al had transferred
to their boat by that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to that point, over there,&rdquo; the man
added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s closest to where I dropped my
motorcycle when I saw the thing happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded. The presence of the motorcycle
beyond the lake, where it was nearest to the
road, explained why they had seen the man
swimming toward them. He must have heard
and seen the airplane, watched its descent, and
then rushed to see what he could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t the police want you to testify, or
whatever it is?&rdquo; asked Al.</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If they do, they can find
me soon enough. I&rsquo;m off to get into dry duds.
I didn&rsquo;t waste time riding around the end of
the lake. I dropped my motorcycle and ran in
to see what I could see.&rdquo; He smiled, sadly. &ldquo;I
guess I was too late, even at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking them as he climbed onto the rocky
shore, he pushed the bow of their boat into the
stream again, and watched them turn in the still
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell the police I didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d
need me right away,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m passing
through this section, and I don&rsquo;t want to be held
up and kept here for any sort of investigation.
You saw as much as I did. Well&mdash;goodbye!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>He turned, and as they heard the &ldquo;crash &rsquo;bus&rdquo;
arriving from the airport in a nearby city of
which they lived in the suburbs, Bob rowed his
two young companions back toward the airplane.</p>
<p>The police came, and many others with them
and after them.</p>
<p>Preparations were made to drag under the
craft, and to lift it, if tackle could be gotten
into suitable position, to see if any trace of the
missing pilot could be discovered.</p>
<p>Nothing further developed, however, and one
of the &ldquo;mechs&rdquo; with the airport &rsquo;bus told Bob
it would be afternoon before they got the monoplane
out. The three comrades had given the
police lieutenant all the information they could.
There was a healthy appetite making itself felt
among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; Bob suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, all of you,&rdquo; urged the reporter for a
small suburban daily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make heroes of you
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Protesting that they had done nothing heroic
and that they did not want to be &ldquo;put in the
paper&rdquo; for doing their duty, Curt and Bob refused
to answer any questions. The police, Bob
said, might not want information published. He
did not know, but he would prefer not to talk.
&ldquo;Oh, I see&mdash;there is a mystery, then!&rdquo; the reporter
declared. &ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t talk&mdash;&rdquo;
he began to write swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we won&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; Bob commented as the
trio walked toward their bicycles. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll write
something anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer that there isn&rsquo;t any trace of the
pilot.&rdquo; Al&rsquo;s mind returned to the tragic part of
the crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he jumped clear, got away and went
into the water, and then, coming up, got to
land. He may be on shore, somewhere, hurt, or
too weak to make himself known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt&rsquo;s explanation renewed their hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s that way,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ve got a long road to breakfast. Mother
will be just about wild. I left a note, but she
will worry about Al and me, just the same. If
we go to the ball park and don&rsquo;t get home within
half an hour after the game, she frets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, boys.&rdquo; A pleasant voice behind
them caused the three to wheel around. They
saw a pleasant-faced man, beside an automobile,
parked close to the bicycles they were disentangling.
&ldquo;If you want to get home in a hurry,
pile the bicycles in that little comfort station
over there, and tell the attendant &lsquo;Barney&rsquo; said
to look out for them. I&rsquo;m from the aircraft
plant, and as long as I can&rsquo;t do anything here,
if you&rsquo;ll hop into my car I&rsquo;ll ride you home
while you give me the facts as well as you know
them about this smash. It&rsquo;s a bad thing, and
I want to get as straight as I can what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were very grateful to Barney, who neglected
to furnish any other name. He waited
until they had stowed away the bicycles, and
while he drove them toward the village he questioned
them rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are all very brave, and quick,
and fine,&rdquo; he commented, after they had, in turn,
recited their adventures. &ldquo;You acted splendidly
and I thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did our duty,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But why are
you thanking us? I know it was one of the Tredway
airplanes because we were in it, with Lang,
yesterday on check-up. But who was in it, and
what do you think happened&mdash;really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner of the manufacturing plant was
in it,&rdquo; said Barney, very soberly and sadly. &ldquo;Mr.
Tredway was flying it himself. He wanted to
deliver it in person&mdash;for a reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a reason?&rdquo; Bob repeated, inquiringly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barney. &ldquo;There is a mystery
behind that crack-up&mdash;it&rsquo;s more likely it&rsquo;s a
&lsquo;washout.&rsquo; Anyhow, there is something behind
the smash, and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard there is a private
detective, a Mr. Wright, at Forty-one Elm. If
you can tell me the quickest way to get there,
I&rsquo;ll appreciate it. I want to consult him&mdash;on this
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, Curt and Al stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s father!&rdquo; said Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Then I am glad I offered you a
&lsquo;lift.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They directed him, and eventually he drew up
the car before the neat, cozy cottage. Curtis,
accepting the invitation to stay for their somewhat
belated breakfast, sat, with Bob and Al,
in the cheerful breakfast room, finishing up a
stack of pancakes thickly syruped, when Bob
was sent for.</p>
<p>Returning, after a few minutes, he showed his
younger brother and his best friend a face of
elation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a mystery, all righty,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re to come with me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; retorted Bob, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re&mdash;in&mdash;on&mdash;it!&rdquo;
As the others jumped up he added,
&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s home and he&rsquo;s taken a real air mystery
case!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE SKY SQUAD IS FORMED</span></h2>
<p>Entering Mr. Wright&rsquo;s library, which the
detective used as a reception room for clients,
Bob, Curtis and Al could hardly repress their
excitement. To share in the possible solution
of a real mystery of the airlanes was more
than they had really dared to hope for.</p>
<p>Seated opposite Mr. Wright, smiling pleasantly,
was the man who had given no other
name than Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Wright.&rdquo; Curtis Brown
greeted the quiet, but cordial father of his two
chums. Al added a salute to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; suggested the detective. Bob,
Curt and Al ranged themselves along the
leather upholstered davenport at the side,
where the light was on their faces. Mr. Wright
had his room so arranged that only his own
place beside the desk enabled him to keep his
face in the shadow; clients and other visitors
had to show every expression in the light from
the two sunny windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>While Mr. Wright seemed to be deciding how
to disclose his plans, Curt compared the two
men.</p>
<p>They were of very distinct types. Fred
Wright would make anybody think of an ordinary,
everyday business man, fairly prosperous,
quiet in his manner, affable and cordial in
his speech. His calm, serious face was neither
severe nor too soft; and while its steel-gray
eyes were kindly, they could look through a
person, it seemed, and find out, almost, what
that one was thinking, or, perhaps, trying to
conceal.</p>
<p>Barney, on the other hand, made one think
of a working man who had risen to a position
of prosperity and influence without being able
entirely to shake off his servile, unpolished manner.
Although his clothes were expertly tailored,
he seemed a little ill at ease in them. What was
more, he gave the impression that he knew it!</p>
<p>He was a trifle blustery to cover his feeling
of inferiority, Curt decided; and he had a habit
of interrupting when another person was speaking.
However, this might be due to excitement,
Curt thought charitably.</p>
<p>Glancing sidewise, he sensed that much the
same comparisons were passing through Bob&rsquo;s
mind. Al gave no thought to character. His
whole attention was bent on the possibility of
&ldquo;action!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Curt, who liked to look for good points more
than for the other sort, checked up Barney&rsquo;s
dark eyes, almost black, and decided that they
were only serious because of the gravity of the
situation. They could twinkle with fun, he
guessed; also, the mouth was so shaped that Bob
admitted to himself that Barney smiled oftener
than he scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told Mr. Horton about you three
young aviation enthusiasts,&rdquo; Fred Wright began.
&ldquo;Also I have explained that you used to
be very fond of &lsquo;detecting&rsquo; in a decidedly amateurish
way, of course.&rdquo; He smiled across the
desk toward Barney, whose face broke into a
broad, pleased grin, immediately suppressed because
of the seriousness of his errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we were amateurish,&rdquo; chuckled Bob.
&ldquo;Why, Mr. Horton&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me Barney&mdash;just Barney,&rdquo; the visitor
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say so, sir. Well, Barney, then! We
were crazy to be great detectives, because father
is one,&rdquo; he paid the compliment whole-heartedly
and only his father smiled and shook his head
deprecatingly, &ldquo;but we let our enthusiasm take
the place of brains,&rdquo; Bob added. &ldquo;I was not
much help because I let vanity get the best of
cool, common sense&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was a failure because I am too impulsive,&rdquo;
contributed Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so short-sighted, in my mind, that I
forgot to look at the whole of a case and pinned
my nose down onto every little clew,&rdquo; Curt
grinned sheepishly, &ldquo;so I kept going around in
circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Mr. Wright looked over at
Barney, &ldquo;in such work as boys could do&mdash;they
were a few years younger then&mdash;these three
helped me a great deal in handling two quite important
cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trio lowered their heads modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; the detective continued, &ldquo;they
turned from being Master Sleuths, as they
termed themselves, to aviation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airboys!&rdquo; chuckled Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. That is an apt expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t give up wanting to be detectives,
really!&rdquo; exclaimed Al, earnestly. &ldquo;We
were looking for a way to mix the aviation with
the detecting&mdash;only we haven&rsquo;t gotten into
either one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s your chance.&rdquo; Barney said it
very seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Barney has brought me a very baffling
case,&rdquo; Mr. Wright explained. &ldquo;Unfortunately,
I am so deeply involved in another matter that
I cannot drop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can give some time to this, you
said.&rdquo; Barney was earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not personally. That is, I shan&rsquo;t be able
to investigate in person,&rdquo; the detective replied.
&ldquo;That is where our three assistants will
figure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be Airboys and Master Sleuths, both
at the one time,&rdquo; Barney interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; Al clapped his hand to his knee,
unable to restrain his enthusiasm. Mr. Wright,
although with a tolerant, if brief smile, shook
his head at his younger son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be a serious affair,&rdquo; he stated,
forcefully.</p>
<p>Al immediately became sobered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we combine aviation and detective
work?&rdquo; asked Curt, the most practical of the
chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By going to the aircraft plant to work as
mechanics&rsquo; helpers, or whatever positions Barney
sees fit to put you in,&rdquo; Mr. Wright told
them. &ldquo;That takes care of the detective work
because you will have to keep eyes and ears
open and without appearing to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do that easily,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;That takes no effort at all,&rdquo; agreed Al. His
father, knowing Al&rsquo;s expressive face to be easily
read, made no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you are at the aircraft plant,&rdquo; Barney
took up the explanation, &ldquo;you will be working
in and around the crates we are building, and
you will learn a whole lot about how an airplane
is put together, what the parts are for, and how
they are assembled. That&rsquo;s the aviation part.&rdquo;
He emphasized the first syllable, making it
&ldquo;av-iation.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; Al was irrepressible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just show us the jobs!&rdquo; added Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we will be glad to learn.&rdquo; Curt was
more sober. &ldquo;That ought to be one of the first
things for anybody to do who means to be a
pilot.&rdquo; Mr. Wright nodded and Curt proceeded.
&ldquo;A good grounding in airplane construction will
be fine. But&mdash;for the detective part&mdash;I think
we ought to be very serious and consider it carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you should,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Wright.
&ldquo;There is a deeper mystery to be solved than
appears on the surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that,&rdquo; agreed Curt. &ldquo;And we must be
sure that we will be a help and not a hindrance
to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine lad!&rdquo; broke in Barney.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we won&rsquo;t be a hindrance!&rdquo; Al was almost
bouncing on the divan springs in his eagerness.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll watch, and catch whoever you want
caught&mdash;maybe learn to fly a &lsquo;crate&rsquo; and hop off
and fly after him and ride him down and force
him to land&mdash;and there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the party laughed. Al, realizing his childish
lapse into silly chatter, laughed, finally, himself,
a little ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what Curt meant, now,&rdquo; he said, more
quietly; but his excitement was hard to hold.
&ldquo;But, anyhow, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, Barney, we will try to help. We
can learn about airplane construction, and that
will be fine; but we will give all our minds to
watching and listening and doing whatever is
wanted of us&mdash;we ought to form some kind of
club or order, so we would have a head to get
orders from father&mdash;especially if he is too busy
to take part himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sensible, even if it does seem boy-like
to want to have a secret association,&rdquo; said
the older detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s call ourselves what Barney called
us&mdash;the Airboys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that very much,&rdquo; objected Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you pick a name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the game is more important than
the name,&rdquo; observed the older detective.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;but with a good name for our band, and
a chief, we can know where we are,&rdquo; urged Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Curt. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s humor the
youngster!&rdquo; Al grimaced at him, but subsided
as Curt went on. &ldquo;We are detectives as well as
airplane enthusiasts. Why not combine the two
in the name of the order we are to form&mdash;something
about the sky, and something about a
police&mdash;detective squad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it!&rdquo; Barney interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit it? How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sky Squad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crickety Christmas!&rdquo; Curt was as enthusiastic
as Bob and Al became on hearing the
words. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Mr. Wright was patient, but a
little annoyed. &ldquo;That being settled, we can take
up the important matter of&mdash;the case!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">A DOUBLE PUZZLE</span></h2>
<p>Barney stood up and looked at his watch:
also, he frowned a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we didn&rsquo;t have to waste the time,&rdquo; he
objected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve went through it all with you,
Mr. Wright, and I wanted to take these lads
along back to the plant in my car. I wanted to
make it look like I just happened on them at
the accident&mdash;the&mdash;well, the accident, and found
they were interested in av-iation and brought
them back to fill a couple of places in the plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we solve a case if we don&rsquo;t
know what it is?&rdquo; remonstrated Bob.</p>
<p>To that Curt nodded and Al bobbed his head
rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; Barney turned to Bob,
&ldquo;I think you would do a whole heap better if
you went in to it blind, sort of. If you know
all about it, you&rsquo;ll go out to the plant, all serious
and acting like judges or detectives. If you take
it the way our youngest friend, Al, does&mdash;as a
sort of lark&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be suspected so quick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is something in that,&rdquo; Mr. Wright admitted.
&ldquo;Al&rsquo;s face is apt to give him away if
he thinks it is really serious. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all the same, Father,&rdquo; Bob declared,
&ldquo;how will we know what to watch for? How
will we know what to report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch anything you see. Listen to whatever
you hear. Report the whole business!&rdquo;
Barney exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does seem wise,&rdquo; Mr. Wright agreed,
rising also. &ldquo;Boys, let&rsquo;s emphasize the Sky part
of your order, and let the Squad side rest
awhile. Barney wants to get back to the plant&mdash;he
is the Manager, I meant to explain. He
ought to be at the end of a telephone wire. Let&rsquo;s
say only this: There is a double mystery. First
of all, valuable parts have been missed, from
time to time, from the plant. That is a minor
matter, at present, but your first puzzle is&mdash;where
have the missing parts gone and who took
them? But, as I said, that is a minor affair,
because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has tampered with some of the
finished crates,&rdquo; broke in Barney. &ldquo;Why, and
who&mdash;that&rsquo;s the second puzzle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you take that as enough for the
present,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Wright. He turned to
Barney. &ldquo;Now these three young lads are alert,
obedient, and they will follow instructions to the
letter, if you give orders,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You
have already seen how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How quick they are in emergencies! Yes
sirree! All right. I know I can depend on
them. Sorry you can&rsquo;t investigate in person,
Mr. Wright&mdash;but maybe this way will work out
best. Anyhow, nobody at the plant will get suspicious
of these boys. They won&rsquo;t have the
brains of older men, like you and me, but they
will have quick eyes and wide ears,&rdquo; he laughed,
and beckoned, &ldquo;come on, lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little disappointed, feeling that there was
more behind the mystery than Mr. Wright had
disclosed, but accepting his &ldquo;lead,&rdquo; Bob, Al and
Curt caught up their caps from the hall rack
and followed Barney into the car.</p>
<p>As he drove toward the large manufacturing
buildings, the administration offices and the assembling
rooms, &ldquo;dope&rdquo; rooms and testing field
that formed the Tredway Aircraft Corporation
plant, Barney kept away from talk about the
mysteries.</p>
<p>Instead, he questioned them about the plan
for their new organization, suggested secret
codes, urged them to elect a &ldquo;Boss Pilot&rdquo; and
really fired their imaginations to such a point
that when they came in sight of the aircraft
plant they had almost forgotten their disappointment
at not being taken fully into his confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, when they turned in at the
gateway in the high board fence that kept curious
wanderers out of the grounds, &ldquo;here we are,
Sky Squad&mdash;ready to begin to learn how a crate
is started, what the design means, and why certain
things have to be planned for&mdash;and then,
what goes into construction and why, how she&rsquo;s
put together, and then, how to fly the finished
crate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensing from his tone that he wanted them to
concentrate, at least outwardly, on airplane construction
and to let the other part of their activity
be kept quiet, the three comrades agreed
by assuming an interest that was by no means
hard to pretend, when he took them into the
offices, introduced them to some of the men
working there, and explained that he was going
to put them to work &ldquo;to learn to build crates
from the prop to the tail skid.&rdquo; Barney, on the
way, had learned their special interests. Therefore
he put Bob into the engine assembling division
where he could learn more about radial engines
and the experiments being conducted with
oil-burning types. Curt, who was methodical,
cool and careful, was assigned to work, at least
for awhile, in the wing assembling rooms. Al,
being rather young for too much technical understanding,
was assigned as helper to a &ldquo;rigger,&rdquo;
who had been grumbling for some time
at the laziness of his present assistant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Everything was so new and so interesting
that the trio forgot the seriousness with which
Mr. Wright had assembled them that morning;
but as they rode their bicycles toward home at
lunch time, Bob imparted information that both
startled them and turned their minds back to
the serious business really underlying their
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard some talk, this morning,&rdquo; Bob told
his brother and Curt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s serious, fellows!
Missing parts aren&rsquo;t half the puzzle&mdash;and tampering
with airplanes isn&rsquo;t all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is, then?&rdquo; demanded Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think, in the wing assembling room,&rdquo;
Curt put in, &ldquo;that the airplane fell this morning
because something went wrong with Mr.
Tredway. The plant owner was delivering that
craft himself. They all argue that he must have
had a heart attack, or something of the sort,
because the airplane was tested and gone over
thoroughly. They say he must have been taken
sick and lost control. Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard some &lsquo;mechs&rsquo; saying they think he
deliberately made away with himself because of
money trouble or something they don&rsquo;t know
about,&rdquo; added Al. &ldquo;Maybe trouble with his
family, one says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; Bob said soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The talk in the engine plant was that some
enemy deliberately tampered with that airplane
because&mdash;because he knew the owner was to fly
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Curt was astounded, &ldquo;but, Bob&mdash;that
would be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Bob, very gravely, &ldquo;yes&mdash;it
would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes the puzzle about missing parts
and the rest unimportant,&rdquo; Curt commented,
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it still gives us two puzzles to solve,&rdquo;
Al began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; corrected Curt, &ldquo;not two separate
puzzles&mdash;but a double puzzle, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A double puzzle? I don&rsquo;t quite see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one problem,&rdquo; Bob explained to his
younger brother. &ldquo;But it has two sections. First&mdash;was
the airplane tampered with as an act
against the aircraft corporation or against Mr.
Tredway in person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And second?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al did not let Curt complete his deduction.
Al had one of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And second&mdash;who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">SUSPICION AND SUSPENSE</span></h2>
<p>Full of their horrifying suspicions, Curt and
Bob rode on. Al turned off on a side street to
deliver a parcel at the home of his new boss,
&ldquo;Sandy&rdquo; Jim Bailey, the rigger. Al wanted to
&ldquo;make himself solid&rdquo; with the sandy-haired man
whom he already liked and whose grumbling
was over now that he had, as he said, &ldquo;a willin&rsquo;
and brainy helper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt ate lunch with Bob. Both were disappointed
when Bob&rsquo;s mother told them that his
father had been called out of town on his case,
accepted earlier.</p>
<p>Riding back, to rejoin Al, who was waiting at
the gate of the plant ground, Bob accosted his
brother in some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to have lunch?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had it,&rdquo; Al told Bob and Curt. &ldquo;I delivered
that package for Mr. Bailey, and met his son,
Jimmy-junior. He&rsquo;s just about my age, and
an awfully nice fellow. He invited me, so I
stayed.&rdquo; He dismounted and set his wheel inside
the enclosure. &ldquo;You ought to see the model
airplanes he builds. They&rsquo;re great!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t stop to talk about them now.
Mr. Barney Horton left word with the gate-man
we are to come into the administration
offices to see him.&rdquo; Bob led the way as he gave
the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will give us a chance to look over the
office staff,&rdquo; Curt explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Al,&rdquo; his brother warned him.
&ldquo;See that you don&rsquo;t let anybody guess that you
see any suspicious things. You show everything
on your face, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barney greeted them in his private office and
introduced them to Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s partner, Mr.
Parsons, who was there.</p>
<p>If his manner was somewhat abrupt and his
mind preoccupied, Bob made allowances for
that. The man was overcome by the mishap and
its sinister outcome.</p>
<p>His restless, seemingly uneasy, and almost
furtive actions, however, were not so easy to
account for. He seemed unable to meet the eyes
of the comrades directly, and appeared to be
nervous&mdash;even more than the circumstances
justified, Bob thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Almost on top of the introductions he hurried
out, &ldquo;To get out there where the airplane
cracked up and see what&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He takes it mighty hard, he does,&rdquo; Barney
told the youths. &ldquo;No wonder. He&rsquo;s Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s
partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any real certainty that anything
terrible happened to Mr. Tredway,&rdquo; asserted
Curt. &ldquo;He might have jumped clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and maybe he was hurt, and managed
to swim off to some part of the shore and wasn&rsquo;t
able to go any further. They haven&rsquo;t searched
every possible spot have they?&rdquo; Al was hopeful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they have,&rdquo; Barney replied.
&ldquo;Furthermore, there are so many soft, muddy
sink-holes in Rocky Lake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you agree with what the people in the
plant are saying?&rdquo; Al asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my lad. You see, it&rsquo;s a good
idea, having you here. When I&rsquo;m around the
people shut their mouths. But you hear things.
What are they saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think it&rsquo;s something worse than missing
parts and damage done to the &lsquo;crates&rsquo;,&rdquo; Al
answered and explained, calling on Curt and
Bob for their versions of the talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m. Well, Al, I think&mdash;if I were you&mdash;I
wouldn&rsquo;t listen to the talk around the plant
too hard. Pick it up, of course, but don&rsquo;t go
making any theories of your own out of it.&rdquo;
Barney explained that people buzzed like a lot
of flies every time anything happened, and that
many of the less sensible ones, liking to be &ldquo;in
the limelight,&rdquo; worked up almost idiotic theories.
Usually, if they were accepted, they led to unjust
suspicions, he argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those scatter-brains only want an audience
to listen to them,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise
you to listen and let it go out the other ear.
Otherwise you may get off onto the wrong notion.
Better watch out for suspicious actions,
and leave the theories to Mr. Wright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s away,&rdquo; argued Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only temporary, I guess. Anyhow, you can
tell me what you hear and see, and let it go at
that. I&rsquo;ll communicate with Mr. Wright, and
if he thinks there is anything as bad as you say,
I can tell you how to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Curt.</p>
<p>Bob and Al added their own agreement to the
suggestion.</p>
<p>The designer and the engineering staff were
introduced and several hours were devoted to
discussions between them, for the benefit of the
trio, about airplane design and the things that
had to be taken into consideration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;If my young friends are going to learn airplane
building,&rdquo; Barney asserted, &ldquo;it will be
better if they know how important it is to figure
stresses, safety margins, stability and so on, before
ever a design gets on paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought all those things came out in the
tests, after the airplanes are built,&rdquo; Al contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; the designer said. &ldquo;The tests show
us how well we figured and how good the designs
are that we created. But we work everything
out up here before ever an engine part is
cast, a fuselage built or a wing assembled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any other way would be hit or miss,&rdquo; Bob
agreed.</p>
<p>While they learned the many sections into
which an airplane design is divided, and how
carefully every curve, streamline, distribution
of weight, lift of wing and drag of body must
be calculated, Bob decided that no one in the
office&mdash;at least no one with whom he came in
contact&mdash;was acting in any suspicious manner.</p>
<p>Able to do nothing about the accident, the
staff went on with its accustomed work, sadly,
more seriously, to be sure, but steadily.</p>
<p>However, when Bob returned to his engine
assembling work, he met a new character, and
one of whom he at once formed an unsatisfactory
opinion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>By association of ideas Griff Parsons fell
under his suspicion because the youth, about
eighteen or nineteen, was the son of the man
Bob had seen in Barney&rsquo;s office&mdash;Mr. Parsons.
Griff, whose handclasp was flabby, whose eyes
were even more shifty, whose manner was still
more uneasy than his father&rsquo;s had been, did not
impress Bob favorably at all.</p>
<p>He had something on his mind, Bob decided.</p>
<p>Assigned by the engine department foreman
to help Griff fit piston rings onto the small pistons,
to fit the piston assembly into the cylinders,
before the final assembly was made, Bob
learned much, and somewhat more about Griff
than about the nice adjustments of machinery.</p>
<p>If he turned suddenly, Griff almost jumped,
having hard work to control his muscles.</p>
<p>When he spoke of the morning&rsquo;s accident,
Griff, with a scowl, told him to &ldquo;Keep your mind
on what you&rsquo;re doing! That other ain&rsquo;t any of
your business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob had hard work not to show his antagonism
to the gruff, snappish young man; he was
grateful when a summons took him out into the
yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is a good idea to have you fellows
treated as though all you are here for is
to learn about airplanes,&rdquo; Barney greeted him.
&ldquo;Your Cousin Langley is going to take up the
sister ship to the cracked up Silver Flash, this
afternoon, and I&rsquo;m sending all three of you with
him. It will give you a chance to understand
what the designer told you about how carefully
he had estimated the shape and weight of the
new type longerons and how some mistake that
he hasn&rsquo;t been able to figure out yet makes the
new crate tend to slip off sideways too easily.
Langley will show you how he checks and reports,
and then you will understand how every
one of us works in harmony with every other
one, to build our ships airworthy, safe and
steady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they joined Lang, who was busy checking
his dashboard instruments as the engine
warmed up on the line, Bob, Curt and Al did
not hook safety belts on. They had every confidence
in Lang&rsquo;s ability to handle the ship, and
they were more anxious to be near him so they
could talk than to sit along the cabin sides unable
to communicate their news to him over the
roar of the engine.</p>
<p>As soon as Lang sent the powerful engine
into speed, racing down the runway into the
wind, lifting the elevators to catch the propeller
blast and tip upward the nose, then flying level,
just above the ground for those essential few
seconds in which flying speed was regained before
the climb, Al opened the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lang,&rdquo; he cried, pitching his voice to offset
the noise about them, &ldquo;did you know what they
are saying about the accident?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Langley nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be a test flight,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m really flying over to the airport, in the city
suburbs&mdash;Barney wants you along to scatter
and pick up talk there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the airport got to do with the mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney thinks that mysterious crate we saw
in the field might have something to do with it,&rdquo;
Lang responded to Curt&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Barney told us not to go building
theories,&rdquo; Bob objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s older, and better able to see things
clearly,&rdquo; Lang reminded him. &ldquo;So we will climb
pretty high, as if for test dives and slips, and
skids, and barrel rolls&mdash;you&rsquo;d better be sure
to snap your safety belts&mdash;not right now,
though. This crate slips pretty sharp. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re wasting time,&rdquo; declared Bob,
&ldquo;flying to the airport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Lang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, the airplane was carefully
hidden. No one at the airport would know anything
about it. In the second place, I can&rsquo;t see
how it could link in with the crash&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless its pilot was higher than Mr. Tredway,
and flew over him and forced him down&mdash;&rdquo;
Al was excited at his deduction. He felt puffed
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;We would have seen him,&rdquo; objected Curt,
crushing Al&rsquo;s inflated vanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Bob broke in, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s talk about
something else. If Barney sent you for information,
that&rsquo;s that. Never mind what we think.
What I want to do is to get a line on that fellow
named Griff&mdash;Griff Parsons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Lang swung in his seat, catching the
shift of the crate with almost automatic movements
of stick and rudder bar. &ldquo;What about
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the son of the superintendent, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; asked Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Al broke in, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more, I suspect
that &lsquo;super.&rsquo; He looks like the sort who
could do tricky things. Did you see his eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Curt. Lang cut the motor, and
glided gently, to hear better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has that to do with Griff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, surprised at the sharpness of Lang&rsquo;s
tone, frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like the same type as his father&mdash;same
shifty eyes, same restlessness&mdash;furtiveness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! See here!&rdquo; Lang became suddenly
angry. &ldquo;You let that young man alone and keep
your unfair suspicions off him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Al was angry, too, all at once.
&ldquo;Who are you to give us orders?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know who I am if you go on suspecting
innocent people. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll have
Uncle Fred yank you out of there so quick&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you so hot under the collar?&rdquo;
demanded Bob. &ldquo;What is it to you if we suspect
Griff? Is he an angel that we have to keep
our minds off him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a mighty good friend of mine!&rdquo;
snapped Langley.</p>
<p>All of them were angry. Curt, not related
to the others, felt that he ought to intervene between
the quarreling cousins, but something in
the unreasoning fury of Lang&rsquo;s next words
stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; Lang forgot he was piloting an
airplane, and swung around on his seat, his face
working. &ldquo;If you keep on, if you bother Griff,
or try to trail him, or anything&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have Uncle
Fred yank you out of there so quick&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Look out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgotten, the airplane, with no guide, answered
automatically to the thrust of Lang&rsquo;s
foot on the rudder bar as he whirled on his
cousins. The shift of the rudder swung the nose,
and Lang&rsquo;s instinct made him operate it to make
the ailerons bank the ship, but she had almost
lost flying speed, the all important velocity
which gives the wings lifting qualities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Sickeningly the airplane tilted. Al, Bob and
Curt, not strapped fast, tumbled sidewise, and
the unstable craft tipped down.</p>
<p>Abruptly, realizing the slip and the danger,
although they were quite high, Lang &ldquo;kicked
rudder&rdquo; sharply.</p>
<p>To his dismay, there came a dull, snapping
thump and one end of the rudder bar worked
free.</p>
<p>The cable had either come loose or had
snapped!</p>
<p>And, with its unstrapped occupants in a huddle,
on the side which was lowermost, the lower
wingtip turned straight downward, the other
pointed toward the sky, the windowed sides
were in the position of floor and ceiling&mdash;and
the airplane began to fall!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three thousand feet,&rdquo; Lang&rsquo;s eyes consulted
the altimeter. &ldquo;Three&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Momentarily he lost his &ldquo;nerve&rdquo; and faltered.</p>
<p>Bob, on the instant, acted!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE FALLING &rsquo;PLANE</span></h2>
<p>In an emergency, thoughts leap through some
minds quicker than lightning crosses the sky.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s mentality was of that type. Whether
his mind worked through what is called instinct,
or whether he put together many things he had
learned about airplanes, or whether he worked
through a chain of reasoning from beginning to
end in a fraction of a second does not matter.</p>
<p>The important thing was his action.</p>
<p>In an airplane which is falling with wingtips
toward sky and earth, the ailerons which
usually tilt it are practically useless, because
it has no forward movement sufficient to bring
the air against the leading edges of the wings
for lift, or to press against the ailerons to cause
them to function properly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the ship is falling &ldquo;on its
side&rdquo; the elevators which in level flight serve to
lift or to drop the nose, are no longer elevators;
they, because of the position of the ship,
are really the rudders, while the rudder, because
it is then parallel to the ground, assumes
the position and functions of the elevators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>But Bob knew, in a flash, from the action of
the ship, from the free movement of the rudder
bar, that the rudder cable had come loose or
had snapped.</p>
<p>Bob knew, furthermore, that unless he could
drop the nose, &ldquo;give her the gun,&rdquo; and thus&mdash;by
partly diving instead of falling sideways, and
by partly using the propeller pull&mdash;could regain
flying speed, Lang could not get the craft
under control and save them from a crash.</p>
<p>There were seconds, not more, between them
and eternity!</p>
<p>That rudder must be operated.</p>
<p>It must be done before they came too close
to earth to make the maneuvers, necessary to
a safe landing, possible.</p>
<p>Even as he called to Lang, &ldquo;Give her the
gun!&rdquo; his hand smashed through the thin side
of the cabin wall, down where it came together
with the sturdy, but light plates of the flooring.</p>
<p>Because the airplane fell on its side, the side
he smashed was under him, the flooring was at
his side, acting as the sidewall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>He knew that if the lower of rudder cables
in the ship&rsquo;s present position was broken he
could get it there; if the upper one was severed
its end would have dropped down, perhaps
caught on a longeron or on a longitudinal fuselage
brace; he might be able to catch hold of it.</p>
<p>It took but a second to thrust his hand
through the cabin wall, to grip the edge of a
floor plate, to rip it from its temporary fastenings
which were not completed until the tests
made it sure that no further adjustments under
the flooring would be necessary.</p>
<p>Thus disclosed, he could see the under framework
of that part of the fuselage.</p>
<p>Braced so that his body would not crash down
through a window, he looked, and grappled for
the cable end. His fingers touched cable!</p>
<p>For all the exigency of their desperate situation
he tugged very gently and was glad. That
cable was fast! It might lead to the elevators,
the ailerons. Anyway it was not the right
strand.</p>
<p>Again he felt under the edge of what was in
the ship&rsquo;s position, the plate above the one
ripped away. His fingers touched a loose strand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; he panted, grasping the
plate and tugging it partly free so that his arm
could go further in and secure in his gripping
fingers the loose cable end.</p>
<p>In the brief time that this had taken, Lang
had obeyed the call for gas to be fed to the engine.
Idling, it roared into its power pulsations.</p>
<p>There was an instant of fear in Bob&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>If the cable he held were pulled and it depressed
the rudder, which would act in their
position as an elevator or &ldquo;flipper&rdquo; acts, all
would be well. In that case, the propeller blast
striking the rudder airfoil would push the nose
downward, and the ship would begin to dive;
then the air, rushing against the leading edge of
the wings, would cause them to be operative,
even in their sidewise position, and with the
dive and the engine pull giving flying speed,
they could then maneuver.</p>
<p>But if the rudder went upward, it would lift
the nose. Already deprived of all but the little
speed the engine had picked up, the blast on
the rudder, lifting the nose, would cause another
stall, and they would perhaps fall too far
to get the other side of the rudder cable before
he could help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the end of the cable,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Set
yourself, Lang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lang, with a swift glance toward the windows,
which faced the earth, saw the ground
seeming to leap upward toward them. Above
was the silent sky. There was a little margin
of time&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull easy!&rdquo; Lang shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull easy!&rdquo; Instantly Curt relayed the message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy!&rdquo; cried Al.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Bob tensed his muscles, braced himself, gave
a gentle tug and held it.</p>
<p>The nose lowered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it!&rdquo; shrilled Al, relaying Lang&rsquo;s relieved
cry.</p>
<p>The rudder had sent the nose a little downward,
the drop changed into a dive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you pull the rudder further?&rdquo; The message
came swiftly from Lang, through Curt and
Al, to Bob, almost out of one mouth before the
other said it, so quick was the response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Bob did so.</p>
<p>Slowly the ship swung onto a more level keel,
and while Bob clung with fingers that were
growing numb from his excitement, the ship got
flying speed, in a sort of descending spiral, the
elevators could again be made to lift the nose
as flying speed was attained, and the ship was
in control.</p>
<p>The signal to ease off did not come at once.
Lang preferred to hold his present bank and
circle, while he looked over through the lower
cabin windows to sight their position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>In that brief time Curt, also keyed up, had
located the loose end of the cable that led from
the rudder bar; with a piece of strong twine
he made a splice, securely reaved onto the loose
end, led it to the free end in Bob&rsquo;s fingers,
and, since the rudder was hard down and could
be held there by grasping further along the
cable, Bob shifted his grip until Curt was able
to get his twine, doubled, fast on that part of
the cable also. Then, while Lang held his rudder
bar steady, Curt tightened gently until the ends
of the severed strand were almost touching,
made several knots that could not slip&mdash;and the
entire control of the ship was in Lang&rsquo;s hands
again!</p>
<p>They did not feel like going on to the airport,
but Curt, always cool, generally far-seeing,
urged that they do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we go back, we&rsquo;ll have to tell about this,
and create new excitement and talk,&rdquo; he counseled,
and Lang saw the good sense of the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on, and land at the airport,&rdquo; he
agreed, above the sound of his motor. &ldquo;After
we get over our excitement we can think better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they got there, and Lang telephoned
the aircraft plant, the trio, outside the booth,
heard him ask for Griff.</p>
<p>Moodily, sorrowfully, with common consent,
they moved away.</p>
<p>One and all they linked Griff&rsquo;s uneasiness and
Lang&rsquo;s curious anger and immediate call to the
one he called &ldquo;a very good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was bad enough to suspect Griff. But Lang&mdash;Bob&rsquo;s
cousin&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>That was dreadful!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">WATCHFUL WAITING</span></h2>
<p>Moodily walking back toward their airplane,
around which a group of handlers and mechanics
watched one assigned to make sure the cable
splice was entirely safe, Curt spoke quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, maybe we should have waited to hear
what Langley said to Griff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Bob was almost snappish. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to suspect your cousin of anything
wrong,&rdquo; Curt assured the brothers earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any more than I hate it,&rdquo; Al retorted.
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to look at what you see and
hear what comes to your ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; counseled Curt, hoping to
lighten the burden of unhappiness for his
chums, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go slow. You know&mdash;they may be
just friends, close ones. There may not be anything
wrong about Griff. We are likely to be
suspicious, because that&rsquo;s what we are there
for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; objected Al. &ldquo;The cable snaps.
Now that&rsquo;s almost a spick-span new crate. That
cable ought not to fray apart&mdash;it could never
wear so soon. It was&mdash;filed or scraped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t involve Griff,&rdquo; urged Curt,
hoping, if he lightened their suspicion of Griff
the cousin who was his friend would be less suspected.
&ldquo;He works in the engine department.
Anyhow, he knew his friend, your cousin, would
fly the &rsquo;plane. He&rsquo;d never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h!&rdquo; warned Bob.</p>
<p>Langley, looking very glum, came up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked to Griff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Told him what
had happened. He was flabbergasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have reported to Barney&mdash;or
to Mr. Parsons,&rdquo; Bob declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Griff have to know anyhow?&rdquo; Al
was impulsive and did not care if he started a
fresh quarrel or not. The conclusion he jumped
to was that an angry Langley would disclose
&ldquo;secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to warn him against&mdash;you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Langley walked away. But they did not let
him get far ahead of them as they approached
the airplane.</p>
<p>The mechanic who had been in the cabin
greeted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny about that cable,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;How
did it ever get so much use that it wore through?
You must kick rudder every two seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was it worn through&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo; Al began. Curt
prodded his ribs very sharply. As Al became
quiet Curt asked a louder question to distract
the man from pursuing that &ldquo;or&mdash;&rdquo; and learning
their fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or did it break at the rudder bar?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It chafed against the transverse brace it ran
under,&rdquo; the mechanic responded. &ldquo;They ought
to have an eyelet or something for a guide&mdash;a
small pulley would be best, with an eyelet to
keep the cable from slipping out of the groove
and chafing on the solid part of the pulley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll report that,&rdquo; said Curt. &ldquo;A rudder is
pretty important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; replied the mechanic.</p>
<p>The plates had been fastened back into their
light frame, being of sturdy construction and
not permanently attached, they had come away
clean and were put back easily. Only the cracked
hole in the panels gave outward evidence of the
recent near catastrophe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we let on that was an accident, that
I put my foot through the panel,&rdquo; suggested
Curt. &ldquo;Repairing it only means putting in a
new section there&mdash;it ought not to cost much
and I have some money in my savings account
to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all put together,&rdquo; urged Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not tell the truth?&rdquo; snapped Langley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to find out who endangered
you and the rest of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lang considered Bob&rsquo;s sharp phrase. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he said finally.</p>
<p>The best way to do that, argued Curt, was by
watchful waiting, not by putting the possible
malefactor on his guard. &ldquo;They could,&rdquo; Al declared,
&ldquo;see who makes the repair, and I can
watch, being out near the &rsquo;planes, and see if
anybody takes a special interest in the floor and
the cables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Langley agreed rather bruskly and went off
to take up his inquiries about the brown airplane
they had seen in the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watchful waiting!&rdquo; repeated Bob, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good slogan. Let&rsquo;s &lsquo;watchful
wait&rsquo; to see what Griff does&mdash;and how Lang
acts&mdash;and if either of them acts queerly when
they are with Griff&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what makes you suspicious of him&mdash;the
father?&rdquo; Curt asked, more to check up his own
theories than for information. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s
partner, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect him,&rdquo; Al declared, &ldquo;because he&rsquo;s
the kind that looks suspicious, with his quick
action and his sharp talk and his shifty eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Griff is exactly the same in every way,&rdquo;
supplemented Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have two suspects to keep tabs on,&rdquo;
agreed Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; corrected Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave Lang out,&rdquo; urged Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;we won&rsquo;t watch him. But it&rsquo;s bad,
because we can&rsquo;t talk over plans and tell him
everything. There will be&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strained relationship,&rdquo; suggested Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pretend to be the same as ever, but
keep your ideas to yourself,&rdquo; Curt begged. &ldquo;And&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
be watchful waiters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the next week that was the only policy
they would have been able to adopt. Nothing
happened at all.</p>
<p>Al still carried parcels, on occasion, for rigger
Sandy Jim Bailey, and improved his acquaintance
with Jimmy-junior.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright&rsquo;s absence from town during the
entire week prevented them from consulting
that detective. The comrades were thrown on
their own resources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that watchful waiting has gotten
us very far,&rdquo; commented Al as they rode home
for lunch, Curt with the brothers, at noon on
Saturday. The day&rsquo;s work was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know a little more than we did,&rdquo; Curt reminded
him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had talks with some of the
boys I know, and I&rsquo;ve found out that the ones
Griff associates with aren&rsquo;t thought well of.
And Bob has trailed him, several evenings, in
spite of Lang&rsquo;s warning to Griff, and Bob has
told you that Griff always gets away on his
motorcycle and goes somewhere that we can&rsquo;t
locate yet. But we know his character isn&rsquo;t very
high class, and his father still acts uneasy and
preoccupied. So we have gained that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good is it?&rdquo; Al was unconvinced. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t say what happened to Mr. Tredway. It
hasn&rsquo;t told us who is taking airplane parts. It
doesn&rsquo;t explain who tampered with the rudder
cable in the Golden Dart&mdash;or why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bob admitted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, it doesn&rsquo;t.
But it&rsquo;s the best we can do, for the present. And
we never know when something may &lsquo;break.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep on learning airplane technique,&rdquo;
suggested Curt. &ldquo;We know we&rsquo;ve gained there,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Al nodded. &ldquo;I can name the different
parts of a biplane without stumbling over any
of them.&rdquo; He did, &ldquo;&mdash;fuselage; engine; propeller;
upper and lower wing; cockpit and its cowling;
struts and landing and flying wires; stabilizer,
fin, elevator, rudder; ailerons; tail skid; and
landing gear that Sandy calls the &lsquo;trucks.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; agreed Curt. &ldquo;And they comprise
five groupings, each one having a special purpose&mdash;the
fuselage, the supporting structure for
everything else. Everything is attached to that.
Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second group,&rdquo; Bob cut in, &ldquo;is the supporting
surfaces, the wings. They sustain the
whole weight in the air, and the flying wires
take the lift of the wings as the air sustains
them, and communicates it, with the struts helping,
to the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in a way,&rdquo; Bob changed the statement
slightly. &ldquo;The flying wires are to take the stress,
and if it wasn&rsquo;t for them the wings would tilt
up at the ends or tips, like a &lsquo;V.&rsquo; The flying
wires take the stress in flying the same as the
landing wires take the weight of the wings in
landing; without the landing wires, when the
ship came down the wings would crumple down
over the crate like the two slanting sides of a
tent or like the &lsquo;V&rsquo; upside down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Al showed his knowledge, &ldquo;and then
there is the control group, the ailerons at the
backs or trailing edges of the wings, to be
moved upward or downward, to tilt the ship;
and the rudder, to turn it sideways&mdash;and if it&rsquo;s
flying on its side the rudder is performing the
office of the elevators and they of the rudder,
because when it&rsquo;s flying level the elevators are
to tip its nose up for a climb or down for a
glide; then there&rsquo;s the fin and the stabilizers
that give it balance and help to hold the whole
ship in whatever position it is placed by the
movable controls I just mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;And with all those you have a glider,&rdquo; agreed
Bob. &ldquo;The engine, and its &lsquo;prop&rsquo; are for motive
power, and the landing group, either wheels for
the earth, or pontoons for the water, or both,
combined, in an amphibian, for land-and-water
use&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know some things,&rdquo; agreed Curt. &ldquo;But
we don&rsquo;t know where Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s body went&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Griff is going to do with his Saturday
afternoon,&rdquo; commented Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back
to the plant, and pretend to finish up work, and
see what happens there while it&rsquo;s supposed to
be closed down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed. Something might &ldquo;break.&rdquo;
Actually, something did!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">STRANGE ACTIONS</span></h2>
<p>Although the aircraft manufacturing plant
observed a forty-four hour week, closing down
on Saturday afternoons, when the three members
of the Sky Squad returned, about two
o&rsquo;clock, they were somewhat startled to discover
that their &ldquo;suspects&rdquo; were there.</p>
<p>Bob, entering the engine section, discovered
Griff.</p>
<p>The youth was surprised, &ldquo;caught in the act!&rdquo;
mused Bob as he saw the youth, with furtive,
hasty actions, completing the wrappings of a
smallish package which he hurriedly slipped
into his coat as he turned aside, trying to conceal
his action from Bob and then, noting that
he was caught, trying to pass it off as an ordinary
action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where some of the smaller parts
are going,&rdquo; Bob concluded, pretending not to be
aware that anything was wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he greeted. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come back
and take that model engine apart, while no one
was here to bother me, so I can get it straight
in my head just how the valves operate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Griff was inclined to be gruff, and
as he tinkered around trying to pretend to be
busy, but, to Bob&rsquo;s notion, watching the member
of the Sky Squad, the latter gave every impression
he could of ignorance that he was being
supervised, studied, observed.</p>
<p>Had Griff been intruded upon before he finished
what he had been doing? Bob wondered
as he took off the cylinder head of a small,
roughly assembled model of a new design for
a Vee-type motor they were working on. It appeared
that Mr. Tredway had been &ldquo;all for&rdquo;
the newer radial engines, while Mr. Parsons exerted
all his influence to introduce the model in
which the cylinders, in line, came together in a
slanting fashion, like a &ldquo;V&rdquo; at the crankcase
jointure.</p>
<p>Bob took out pistons and pretended to examine
the crankpin assembly.</p>
<p>Griff watched covertly and appeared to be
exceptionally uneasy.</p>
<p>Curt entered from the wing assembly rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Griff.&rdquo; He nodded, paid little attention
to Griff and went over to Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting?&rdquo; he hinted. Bob nodded, and
began to explain the parts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Curt, bent close, whispered his next
words. &ldquo;Lang is out in the yard, working on the
Golden Dart. He has the plates out and he
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke Lang came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Curt,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;run up to the offices,
and if Mr. Parsons or Barney is around, get
me a new&mdash;er&mdash;length of cable, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they give it to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing there&rsquo;s nobody around. The office
is closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the supply room, on the ground floor.
The watchman will let you get what you want.
All you have to do is to write out a requisition
form and put it on the spindle on the desk.
You&rsquo;ll see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get supplies as easily as that?&rdquo; Bob
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely! Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt and Bob made no comment. The former
went to execute Lang&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>In the offices, as he neared the open door
of the bookkeeper&rsquo;s little cubby of a room, Curt
heard two low voices. He hesitated. He was
close enough to be able to recognize in the bent
figure leaning over the other, with his back
turned, the peculiarly checked brown suit which
identified Mr. Parsons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Evidently neither the partner nor his companion
heard Curt, so absorbed were they in
some discussion or comparison of figures.</p>
<p>Curt, wondering why they were so engrossed
in that work when the office was closed, and so
absorbed that they had not heard him&mdash;he had
not tried to snoop or to creep along the hall!&mdash;decided
that it must be legitimate business, and
that he would not disturb them.</p>
<p>He went on beyond to the rear stairway and
down, looking for the watchman.</p>
<p>Al found him there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you get into the supply room?&rdquo;
asked Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do. What&rsquo;s that
you&rsquo;re carrying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an earth inductor compass,&rdquo; Al explained.
&ldquo;You heard Sandy hail me as we came
in.&rdquo; Curt nodded. &ldquo;He stayed on to check up
my work,&rdquo; Al informed him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty raw,
you know, and Sandy is so good-natured that
he didn&rsquo;t want to see me get into any trouble. I
was helping one of the mechs this morning&rdquo;&mdash;he
had already picked up some of the slang,
shortening &ldquo;mechanic&rdquo; as did those in the plant&mdash;&ldquo;and
Sandy was going over the instruments
I had installed. That Golden Dart is going to
be used for an overseas hop, he says&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
he went close to Curt, &ldquo;Curt, I think Sandy has
helped us to get a line on somebody else to suspect&mdash;about
the stolen parts, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He called me over and told me, in a joking
way, I had a lot to learn. And then he asked
me if I knew anything about how this new type
compass operated. I knew a little, but not much,
and he showed me how little I knew. Curt&mdash;&rdquo;
he was very serious&mdash;&ldquo;this is an old, broken
thing. Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated the failure of the parts to operate
correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;d let that get to the checker, Monday,
I&rsquo;d have been suspected of getting away with
the regular, real one. This must have been substituted
by the mechanic who was on that job&mdash;the
one I helped. Or else it was given out by
the clerk who has charge of this room. Anyhow,
Sandy says I ought to put in a requisition for
another one, and then he is going to help me
keep an eye out to see what happens on Monday.
He wants to help us. I saw he was so
afraid I&rsquo;d get the blame, and he&rsquo;s so mad about
the way things are being taken that I let him
in on our secret&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About being detectives?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, only as far as saying we were crazy
about aviation and had formed a sort of order
we call the Sky Squad, and naturally, being
honest, we saw how things were going here and
wanted to do what we could to discover who is
taking parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said not to be too hasty to jump to conclusions.
He told me that this substituting of
the old inductor compass looked like the work
of the mech, but it could be the supply clerk,
or, maybe, somebody outside the plant entirely
who had sent it in, boxed, in a new consignment.
He said the safest way would be to put
in a new requisition, then we&rsquo;d see who acted
guilty when it was discovered. If the supply
clerk is guilty he would never mention it for
fear of being caught. If the mech is the culprit,
the clerk will raise a howl about the exchange.
If they are both innocent, you&rsquo;ll hear
from both of them, and we can trace it to somebody
who sent the consignment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good stuff!&rdquo; agreed Curt. &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t the
mechanic notice it was a broken model of the
compass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave me the instructions how to assemble
it and told me to be careful, and then went over
to work on that small speed craft that Griff is
testing out. Griff called him, so it looks all
right. If the mech noticed this old compass,
before he went home, he&rsquo;ll tell me, first thing
Monday. If he knew about it and had taken the
other, the good one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll lay low. I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman, making his rounds, observed
the pair. Readily enough he admitted them to
the supply department. Either he was of too
unsuspicious a nature, being rather dull, to wonder
or question; or he had been told by Barney
that the youths were especially privileged. In
either case he made no comment as they found
the cable Curt wanted for Lang and the several
extra inductor compasses, neatly boxed, among
the stacked instruments in the shelves.</p>
<p>Making out two of the slips he saw in a pad,
and fixing them on the upstanding spike of a
file, Curt handed Al his box and with the cable
went to find Lang.</p>
<p>Handing the strand to his chum&rsquo;s cousin, Curt
decided to return to the office building to see
what he might see. The excuse that he was
studying the blue prints of an airplane would
furnish reason for his presence in the office if
Mr. Parsons was still there and asked.</p>
<p>Bob, as Lang left, found Griff suddenly and
unaccountably pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny about that cable,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is,&rdquo; admitted Bob, watchful, quiet, but
willing to follow Griff&rsquo;s unexpected lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lang says you had your suspicions of me,&rdquo;
Griff grinned, quite pleasantly. Had he, Bob
wondered, been &ldquo;tipped&rdquo; by Lang to cultivate
friendship? Was there something really underneath
the friendship of the partner&rsquo;s son and
Bob&rsquo;s pilot cousin? Was there something else?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I suppose when we got excited about
that broken rudder pull, we thought of anything
and everything,&rdquo; Bob grinned also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you thought wrong, friend. Would
you try to do any harm to your buddy, Curtis,
if you knew he was to fly a certain crate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bob admitted, honestly and fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some other pilot, jealous, maybe&mdash;might!
Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob had not in any way considered that possible
solution. There was another test pilot,
not as popular as his cousin. He gave the most
serious attention, but Griff evidently felt that
he had said enough, adding only: &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
mean to accuse anybody. Let&rsquo;s forget it. Come
on, let&rsquo;s forget motors and go up and have a
look at them little fleecy clouds.&rdquo; He caught
Bob&rsquo;s arm, after slipping the cylinder head over
the pistons of the model with Bob&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever fly a crate?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not solo!&rdquo; Bob admitted, &ldquo;but Lang has let
me take the controls six or seven times when
he used to take us up, before we came here
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To learn all there is about building airplanes,&rdquo;
Bob continued without the flicker of an
eyelash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m! Well, come on, kidlets! I&rsquo;ll take
you up in the prettiest little crate you ever sat
in&mdash;what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll give you some experience
so you can fly them crates after you get wise
to how they&rsquo;re assembled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evidently a genuinely friendly offer.
If it had any hidden motives, Bob, on that sunny
Saturday, with a gentle, warm vacation wind
blowing, with bonny clouds drifting slowly, gave
up watching and went in for air experience.</p>
<p>Al, finally deserted by Sandy, who had errands
down town, saw Bob and Griff warm up
the little speed sportster he had been rigging.
A little envious he watched the check-up, the
trial spurts of the fast little engine, the take-off
and the soaring of the handsomely designed
craft. Then he went on to visit Jimmy-junior,
whose father, Sandy, had given him a special invitation
to spend the afternoon and to stay to
dinner with Jimmy-junior.</p>
<p>Lang, taking the cabin monoplane for a test
of his rudder performance, called Curt to go
along; so the trio lost interest in detective work
and concentrated on enjoyment&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Until evening!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">A SUMMONS</span></h2>
<p>While Griff, who handled an airplane expertly,
was executing dives and slips, barrel
rolls and figure eights, and a loop or so to demonstrate
his skill, Bob, in the rear cockpit
seat, wondered whether Griff was trying to
frighten him.</p>
<p>That was not his purpose, Bob decided, and
he was more convinced when Griff, with a grin,
turned, after waggling the stick and holding
both hands up beside his head&mdash;the signal to
&ldquo;take control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Under Lang&rsquo;s tuition, in several airplanes,
during tests, Bob had been permitted to handle
the stick, rudder and throttle. He knew the elementary
movements of straight flying and had
some of &ldquo;the feel of the air&rdquo; which comes to any
person who has the flying sense: that &ldquo;feel of
the air&rdquo; is akin to knowing what the ship is
going to do and, of course, sensing how to meet
its various tendencies. When, during a climb,
with too steep an angle, the controls begin to
get &ldquo;loggy&rdquo; for an example, the born pilot, or
the trained fellow with his air-sense developed,
knows instinctively that the ship is about to
stall, and automatically drops the nose and
picks up flying speed.</p>
<p>For awhile Bob, flying straight, or banking
and turning, remained near the small flying field
of the plant. He knew the signals with which a
flying instructor guides his pupil, and, handling
the dual control section in his own hands, and
with his feet, he made simple maneuvers under
Griff&rsquo;s direction, and seemed to please Griff by
the quickness with which he caught the corrections
signaled to him when he over-banked, or
let the ship skid too long without catching the
skid.</p>
<p>The trial was over all too soon, and as Griff
took over to shoot the field and set down, the
most ticklish part of flying tactics, Bob felt a
trifle sheepish for having suspected him.</p>
<p>Griff was, really, quite a pleasant fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>However, Bob began to think. This sudden
affable manner must have some reason behind
it. Furthermore, he decided, Griff might be
trying to win his confidence through the hidden
flattery of telling Bob what a &ldquo;corking&rdquo; pilot
he would make with a little more training. Bob
knew that flying is taught carefully by any self-respecting
school, that a thorough ground-school
training and many hours of instructed
flight will be followed by many solo flights, with
intermittent check flights under the instructor&rsquo;s
eyes, before a pilot is considered more than a
student. Griff over-flattered.</p>
<p>Bob, as he went home, where Al and Lang
had preceded him, his cousin having stopped in
for dinner, decided that he would accept Griff&rsquo;s
offered friendship with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Al was there, of course, but no confidences
were exchanged.</p>
<p>Al had already eaten his dinner, with Jimmy-junior,
after a fun-filled afternoon during which
Jimmy had displayed his airplane models, had
supervised many trials while he let his guest
wind the sturdy rubber band motors and set the
tiny, practicable controls of the toys. Furthermore,
he had talked about the Sky Squad idea
and had begged to be permitted to join, being
air-crazy, as he put it. Al, promising to take
the matter up with his brother and with Curt,
had said he would do all he could to induce them
to agree. He could not broach the matter, however,
as Curt, Bob and Lang ate, because Lang
was full of the excitement of receiving a telegram
from Bob&rsquo;s and Al&rsquo;s father, the detective,
from a city about fifty miles away, asking Lang
to come to the city for a report and a conference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Glancing at Bob, both Curt and Al saw that
the older member of the secret membership was
disturbed in his mind. Lang would not tell about
Griff, as he visited his uncle over Sunday. That
was what Bob was thinking, as Al and Curt
saw. But Curt, looking at his watch, reminded
Lang that he must stop stuffing down the filet
of sole, a form of fish steaks of which he was
extremely fond, if he expected to &ldquo;make&rdquo; the
&rsquo;bus that would pass the house on the way to
the city, and the railway station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fly!&rdquo; Lang declared, reaching
for more fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not take us, then?&rdquo; demanded Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to borrow Griff&rsquo;s sport model.
More speedy and I want to check before it is
turned over to him finally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;d be room for one of us,&rdquo; Bob spoke
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sirree!&rdquo; and they knew why Lang was
so snappish.</p>
<p>Bob pushed back his chair as Al and Curt
sprang up. Lang, rising with his superior,
amused grin at their anxiety, waved them back
and kissing his aunt and thanking her for the
fish he loved, he departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo; said Bob, and explained excitedly
to his mother that he had information of
importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lang will tell it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Explain to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s face fell, as did Al&rsquo;s. They were in a
box!</p>
<p>They could not explain to their mother that
they suspected Lang, at the very least, of protecting
Griff, a friend but not a desirable one.
Whatever their own ideas they were none of
them blabbers.</p>
<p>Bob ran out on the porch, leaped down the
steps, hopped on his bicycle and pedaled down
the first side street. He was not entirely sure of
his plans, perhaps he half intended to secrete
himself in the fuselage of the &rsquo;plane, to go on as
an unsuspected passenger; possibly he hoped
to induce Lang to take him by getting there first.</p>
<p>At any rate, as he neared the plant, he was
glad he had come.</p>
<p>Griff, at the gate, was in close communication
with a mysteriously furtive stranger!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A TRAIL AND A FLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Twisting his handlebars sharply, Bob sent his
bicycle into brush at the end of the aircraft
plant grounds where the fence turned; he
wanted to get out of sight.</p>
<p>The pair at the gate were having some sort
of argument and probably had been too excited
and absorbed to notice him, Bob decided.</p>
<p>He dropped his wheel and crept back to the
corner of the fenced enclosure to watch.</p>
<p>From that position he could see the man, but
only part of Griff&rsquo;s coat and an arm. The man,
as he saw, was vigorously arguing. Griff must
have been either pleading or arguing, Bob
guessed, from the man&rsquo;s violent gestures and
appearance of &ldquo;laying down the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently a small, flat package came into
view.</p>
<p>Bob recalled that he had seen Griff wrapping
exactly that sort of parcel earlier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>The man took it, put it rapidly into his coat
pocket, inside. With a quick look up and down
the deserted highway he swung and crossed to
a car parked on the opposite side of the road.
Climbing in he speeded up his engine and drove
away at constantly increasing speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are dividing the &lsquo;spoils&rsquo;&mdash;or Griff
was giving him money.&rdquo; Bob, unable to see
Griff, not daring to emerge from his concealment,
made the deduction under his breath.
&ldquo;Well, now shall I follow that man? No, because
his car is too fast. I can&rsquo;t catch him on
my wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He decided to wait where he was, to see what
would happen. To go in at once might alarm
Griff. He might realize that Bob had been near
enough to see what had occurred; he might
suspect. Bob wanted to keep his presence unknown;
Griff had already been warned by Lang;
he would jump to the conclusion that Bob was
watching.</p>
<p>Almost at once Bob thanked his good sense
for holding him concealed.</p>
<p>Griff, as he watched, ran wildly out into the
road and began to wave and shout after the
receding car.</p>
<p>Its driver did not turn around.</p>
<p>Griff, while Bob stared, dashed back into the
gateway. For a moment Bob wondered where
the watchman was, then he saw the man, in a
small ice-cream and soda water shack, a little
distance down the road opposite the fenced
property. Griff, Bob guessed, had offered to
watch the gate while the man refreshed himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Bob hesitated. Where had Griff gone? What
was he doing?</p>
<p>The last question was answered by the pop-pop
of a motor. Bob knew that Griff rode a
motorcycle. He was getting it started. He meant
to pursue that car for some reason. Something
had caused him to want to talk again with the
car driver, Bob mused.</p>
<p>While he watched, keeping all but his head
concealed, the motorcycle, with Griff mounted
on it, came sputtering into view.</p>
<p>Never glancing around, opening his throttle,
he pelted down the road after the car.</p>
<p>Bob, without hesitation, rushed his bicycle
into the highway and pedaled after the motorcycle
for all he was worth. Griff was too intent
on his purpose to notice, he felt sure.</p>
<p>It would be a losing race, Bob feared, unless
Griff overtook that rapidly receding car very
soon. Muscles could not endure against a machine!
Nevertheless Bob rode as fast as his
pedals would turn.</p>
<p>As he sent the wheels spinning along it
crossed his mind that Lang would be arriving
at the plant almost any moment but he kept on
all the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will take Lang awhile to warm up the
engine, and, anyway, if I don&rsquo;t go with him I
know another way to communicate with father,&rdquo;
he decided.</p>
<p>The car was almost out of Bob&rsquo;s sight, the
motorcycle was rapidly overtaking it.</p>
<p>At that instant Bob&rsquo;s heart almost stopped
beating!</p>
<p>Far ahead, on a cross road, he saw a huge
truck come into view. It was not only between
the car and its pursuer; it was also well onto
the road and almost directly in front of the
motorcycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Griff!&rdquo; Bob shouted, without thinking that
his voice would never be heard. He instinctively
cried a warning. If the rider had his head low
over his handlebars!&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>His coaster brake jammed on, Bob slowed,
alighted, his muscles refusing to function for
the instant.</p>
<p>But during that instant Griff evidently saw
the huge obstacle and swerved. In making the
wild curve to go around the rear of the truck
Bob saw the youth and cycle go off the road into
the ditch.</p>
<p>Evidently unaware that anything had happened
the truck driver kept on down the cross
road. Bob, remounting, pedaled for all he was
worth toward the scene of the accident. As he
rode swiftly he saw other figures approaching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>At the point where the motorcycle lay on its
side, he was met by Al and Curt, who had been
approaching from the opposite way, up the side
road. &ldquo;We decided to come and see Lang hop
off,&rdquo; Al explained as the trio ran toward Griff.</p>
<p>He was sitting up, a little shaken, a little
dazed, when they approached. Bob, seeing that
he did not appear to be seriously hurt, caught
Curt&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;I
want to go with Lang. Don&rsquo;t say I was following&mdash;you
know&mdash;keep it quiet. I must get to see
father and tell him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Don&rsquo;t waste any time. Get out
of sight. I&rsquo;ll tell Al.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob hurried off, as though he was in search
of aid, and he felt, as he pedaled back toward
the field, that Griff probably had been too much
shaken to notice that Bob had come from the
direction he had been riding, or deduce that Bob
had followed him.</p>
<p>The watchman, and several others from the
soda stand came running down the road. They
called out as he approached and with a brief
explanation that there had been a &ldquo;spill&rdquo; but
that he thought it was not serious, Bob rode on.</p>
<p>He found Lang riding toward the plant, and
swung his bicycle in at the gate and set it
against the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, up there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Griff took a spill going around the back of
a truck that came out of the side road. I think
he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; Bob called out his answer to
Lang&rsquo;s shouted inquiry and saw his cousin ride
on to investigate.</p>
<p>Bob, with some idea in his mind that he might
crawl into the fuselage of the small speed
&rsquo;plane, and, thus stowed away, be carried to the
city from which his father had telegraphed,
changed his mind. The close, smothery fuselage,
subjected to the most violent rolling and heaving
of the airplane&rsquo;s progress, would probably
make him ill. He preferred to stay outside, to
see what happened, and to compel Langley to
take him as a passenger.</p>
<p>Watching from the gateway he saw that Griff
had been lifted to his feet and had apparently
found himself only rather badly shaken. This
was Bob&rsquo;s decision because he saw a passing car
driver help the shaken youth into his car, tumble
the motorcycle out of the grass and turn it over
to the plant watchman to be trundled back, and
drive off to take Griff home, it seemed.</p>
<p>Bob met Lang beside the propeller of the
little speed craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the ignition key from Griff?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb in. I&rsquo;ll give the prop a twist for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Langley got himself set.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gas on?&rdquo; called Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob gave the propeller a couple of revolutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contact!&rdquo; he cried, leaping aside to avoid
the flailing, knife-like edges of the blades. The
engine caught on the touch of spark to compressed
gas mixture.</p>
<p>While Langley opened the throttle and
warmed up his engine, Bob unconcernedly began
to clamber into the after cockpit seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Lang,&rdquo; Bob leaned close to Lang&rsquo;s
ear to carry his message above the noise of the
radial engine, &ldquo;which suits you best? To have
me with you, to tell dad what I know before
your face&mdash;or to have me telegraph him while
you&rsquo;re on your way, and let you explain to him
what I have to tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lang, at first furious, presently saw the logic
of Bob&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;all right!&rdquo; he grunted and &ldquo;gave her
the gun&rdquo; in somewhat vicious spurts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Bob, fitting on the &ldquo;crash helmet&rdquo; kept in the
&rsquo;plane by Griff for him that afternoon, and the
leather jacket and gloves, smiled.</p>
<p>He was progressing as a Master Sleuth, doing
his share creditably for the Sky Squad.</p>
<p>As soon as the engine was sufficiently warm
and methodical Lang had checked all his instrument
readings, the trim little ship taxied down
the smooth field to head into the wind which Bob
saw, from the &ldquo;windsock&rdquo; blowing out from its
mast on the office building, was from the south,
a nice, light, Summer evening breeze.</p>
<p>The watchman, coming in, put aside the
slightly damaged motorcycle and strolled across
to the hangars, into one of which he stepped
to throw a switch, lighting the flood light by
which they could see to take off. He did not
question Lang&rsquo;s right to use the craft because
Lang must have gotten its ignition key from
Griff, its owner.</p>
<p>As they took the runway, and increased speed
to the throaty roar of the engine, Bob felt that
sense of the ship getting &ldquo;light&rdquo; which indicates
to the pilot that she is ready to take the air. He
saw the elevators tip, glancing around swiftly
to check the safety of the way ahead, and then
saw the lighted earth dropping, contracting into
a spot of vivid light against a field otherwise
dark; then the watchman shut out the floods to
avoid confusing them in the air, and the ship
climbed into dark night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>They had climbed several thousand feet and
were headed into the north, so that Lang could
&ldquo;pick up&rdquo; the lights of the airway along which
his night flying would be easiest, when Bob saw
him double unexpectedly.</p>
<p>For an instant the craft&rsquo;s nose went almost
straight down and Bob was glad he had
strapped himself in; then Lang evidently caught
control, and the stick, thrust forward as he
doubled, with some unexpected convulsion or
&ldquo;stitch,&rdquo; was pulled back and brought the ship
out of the dive gradually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Bob screamed above the
engine noise, the song of wind through wires
caused by their dive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cramp!&rdquo; called Lang, cutting the gun as he
held a glide for a moment, turning a white face
toward Bob. &ldquo;Listen. Bob&mdash;oh!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent again. &ldquo;The fish&mdash;too much fish&mdash;&rdquo;
Bob guessed, and had he known that Lang&rsquo;s delay
in reaching the field had been due to further
refreshments, he would have said, &ldquo;Fish&mdash;and
ice-cream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At least that was a far more reassuring
thought than Bob&rsquo;s first idea, that some one had
tampered with some control of this craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; Evidently Lang was very ill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Suddenly, as he saw his companion in the
forward seat double, Bob felt the stick waggle
against his leg.</p>
<p>In an interval between his spasms of violent
pain, Lang held up his two hands alongside his
helmet.</p>
<p>It was a signal for Bob to take control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he called, and, with a steady
hand, he clutched the stick of the controls in his
cockpit, set his feet against the rudder bars, and
eased his throttle open to regain speed.</p>
<p>He was not in the least nervous or flurried.
He pitied Lang&rsquo;s cramped stomach and evident
suffering, but did not permit it to influence his
steady nerve. He had been given enough lessons
to know how to hold the craft in level
flight. While night flying was not as safe and
easy as daytime work, he knew that if he followed
the ribbon of lighted highway that ran
toward the beacons of the nearest airway, he
could always &ldquo;set down&rdquo; on the asphalt, if worst
came to worst, and if he did smash the trucks,
the landing gear, he did not think he would do
any more serious damage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Had I better set down?&rdquo; he shouted, gliding
for speed as he cut out the engine roar. Lang
shook his head and gestured forward. Evidently
he was not afraid of any immediate physical collapse
and preferred to go on flying to see if he
would recover. Bob held on.</p>
<p>He picked up the beacon and, watching
Lang&rsquo;s gestures, swung in a long, banked curve,
to head across the wind down the unconfined airway,
whose second beacon he could see, far
away.</p>
<p>By habit looking around to be sure no other
ship was close as he turned, Bob, startled, saw
the flying lights of another craft pursuing.</p>
<p>It must be pursuit! It came from the direction
they had come. It turned as they turned,
only in a more sharpened bank, so as to cut off
part of the distance, it seemed to Bob, to close
the gap between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lang!&rdquo; he shouted, and waggled the stick.</p>
<p>Lang looked around.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s arm pointed backward and upward.</p>
<p>Lang, leaning out of the cockpit, to see around
the wing-tip, stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabin &rsquo;plane!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I know it.
Golden Dart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as Bob opened the throttle to regain flying
speed without having to dip down too low,
there came from the other ship a red flare.</p>
<p>It was, as Bob realized, a signal&mdash;not of
danger but of command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Land!&rdquo; it commanded.</p>
<p>Bob looked at Lang.</p>
<p>Lang considered. As he hesitated Bob guessed
his thoughts. Some one from the small field,
some member of the plant staff, probably Mr.
Parsons, finding the &rsquo;plane belonging to Griff
gone, and hearing from the watchman who had
taken it, had taken off in the cabin monoplane
to stop what he probably considered a prank of
Lang and Bob&mdash;some night-flying lark.</p>
<p>What would Lang say? Set down? Or&mdash;go
on?</p>
<p>They could outfly that cabin ship in the
speedy, easily maneuvered sport craft&mdash;or, they
could, with Lang at the controls. But Lang was
badly upset in his stomach. What would he decide?
Bob mechanically looked around for the
best spot to set down.</p>
<p>When he looked up again his heart leaped
with exultation.</p>
<p>Lang&rsquo;s arm pointed straight ahead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he gestured.</p>
<p>Bob opened the throttle joyously. Here was
adventure, pursuit, thrill enough to suit anyone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE CHASE</span></h2>
<p>Rapidly Bob considered the situation.</p>
<p>The speed craft he and Lang occupied had
much the best of it on a straight flight, but,
against that, he had to set his inexpert handling.
The smaller craft could out-climb, out-maneuver
the cabin ship but he had no experience in stunting,
especially dangerous at night.</p>
<p>Therefore Lang&rsquo;s decision was the safest one.</p>
<p>To try to make a landing, Lang evidently concluded,
was not wise. He felt that he could take
over the controls before that need arose, Bob
guessed.</p>
<p>A new complication came, however.</p>
<p>If the cabin ship had the disadvantage of being
slower, she had gained an offsetting advantage
before they saw her. She was much higher
in the air than their craft; she could dive, if her
pilot chose, and thus close the distance between
them&mdash;maybe come down &ldquo;on their tail,&rdquo; or ride
them to earth, if her pilot proved to be determined
to force them to land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Accordingly Bob opened the throttle wider,
and slightly elevated the nose to climb.</p>
<p>Lang, peering upward and to the rear, made
a violent, vigorous gesture.</p>
<p>Bob, reading it, understood.</p>
<p>He did not question. Lang called for a sideslip!</p>
<p>Instantly Bob manipulated ailerons and rudder
correctly and felt the wind on the cheek
toward the lower side of their bank, telling him
they were slipping.</p>
<p>Then, applying rudder and other controls to
check the slip, dropping the nose again to pick
up flying speed quickly, he saw why the maneuver
had been executed. The cabin airplane
had begun to dive down from above them. Lang,
having seen it, anticipated. He had not wanted
to wrest away control&mdash;too dangerous. He had
risked the signal, and Bob had executed his
order accurately.</p>
<p>He was glad, all the same, when Lang shook
the stick, tapped on his own helmet to sign that
he wanted the controls.</p>
<p>Bob relinquished them thankfully enough. At
night, in strange surroundings, in an airplane
he had only handled a little, he was not foolish
enough to wish to risk neck and limb&mdash;far less
Lang&rsquo;s than his own!&mdash;by trying to outfly a
pilot who evidently meant to be vicious, to resort
to war tactics if they did not obey his
signals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Lang, somewhat recovered, took over and
Bob, delighted, watched his expert manipulation
of the splendid little ship. She answered his
every command. He barrel-rolled out of the
way of any immediate danger, thus leaving the
cabin craft well to one side. He started up a
loop after a swift dive, but at its top he executed
half of a barrel-roll, and since the top
of the loop had the nose in the direction opposite
their course, the half-roll put the craft on
its level, upright course, but going directly away
from the former one.</p>
<p>The cabin ship could not be stunted that way,
or else its pilot against his will was compelled
to recognize superior tactics.</p>
<p>At any rate, as Lang swung around in a wide
circle, slowly climbing at the same time, the
other craft seemed to be heading uncertainly
back.</p>
<p>It came around, however, as soon as Langley
straightened out on the former course along the
airway; but they rapidly outflew it and when
they landed at an airport in the distant city
suburbs, the cabin ship was nowhere in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>It was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock at night when
Bob and Langley were ushered up the hotel
elevator and along a corridor and into Mr.
Wright&rsquo;s rooms.</p>
<p>The detective, who had been apprised, long
distance, by his wife, that his nephew was flying
to keep the appointment, was waiting.</p>
<p>Hardly had his surprise at Bob&rsquo;s presence
been expressed and a late supper for the air-hungered
pair been ordered than another visitor
was announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is where you were bound for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Bob&rsquo;s amazement, Barney spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you leave word that you were
coming here?&rdquo; he said, rather sharply. &ldquo;We
could all have come together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know you were on your way
here,&rdquo; said Langley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you were chasing us,&rdquo; Bob
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was. The watchman said you hopped
but he didn&rsquo;t say where to. I was coming over
to confer with Mr. Wright, but I thought Lang
and you, Bob, were joy-riding. So I signaled
you to land and when you didn&rsquo;t I decided to
scare you into setting down&mdash;but it failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to know better than to think I could
outfly Lang,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve come
with information, it&rsquo;s all right. We can have
a conference, all together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>They did so, over the dinner. Lang listened
to Bob&rsquo;s recital of the latest developments about
Griff, with growing anger, until he saw Barney&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Bob,&rdquo; commented Barney. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
sort of had a notion in my head for some time
about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Griff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve thought he was the one who&rsquo;s
crossed the wires on us and short-circuited the
whole plant. So he divided with somebody, did
he? Well&mdash;he must have gotten it from somebody
higher. Have you thought about?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father?&rdquo; broke in Bob. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;we have!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">THE DETECTIVE&rsquo;S THEORY</span></h2>
<p>More startling than Bob&rsquo;s fresh information
was the revelation given by Barney, the information
which had brought him, flying, to consult
the detective he had engaged to solve the
puzzling case.</p>
<p>All that Bob had to tell was the suspicious
act of the youth, Griff.</p>
<p>Barney, because it was so late, gave only a
hint; but what he said caused a great deal of
sleeplessness on Bob&rsquo;s part, at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got the wrecked airplane up,&rdquo; Barney
told them all, that night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it hauled in
and dismantled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to give his next words more emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t one thing wrong with that
crate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, during their Sunday morning conference,
he amplified his statements, the mystery
deepened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Dismantled, thoroughly examined, by Barney,
in person&mdash;he did not trust any subordinate in
so important a matter&mdash;the airplane revealed
nothing wrong, either with its engine, with its
wings, or with its controls!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it fell,&rdquo; commented the detective.
&ldquo;What, do you imagine, caused the crash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it up.&rdquo; Barney was unable to make a
theory. &ldquo;I hired you to do the doping out of
that! I give you the facts. You do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; his father turned to the youth, &ldquo;have
you jotted down all the suspicious things you
mentioned, as I asked you to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded and handed over a paper.</p>
<p>After consulting it and comparing it with a
sheet on which he had written, Mr. Wright
looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what we know,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;For several
months, according to Barney&rsquo;s original explanation,
when he gave me the case, airplane
parts had been missed. Not very many, but
some. We have to decide how they are taken,
and then find out who does it and what happens
to them, how they are disposed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the man who gives out the instruments
and such?&rdquo; asked Langley quickly.
Bob thought he said it to forestall comment
about Griff, &ldquo;or the mechanics whom Al had
been told by his rigger boss were possible culprits?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been able to watch everybody,&rdquo;
Bob said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That point is not important,&rdquo; Mr. Wright
declared. &ldquo;It is the beginning of what we know,
and can wait. Our second bit of knowledge&mdash;and
more important this is, too&mdash;is that for
several months before the seemingly fatal crash,
accidents had occurred to every airplane that
was sent out of the plant. Buyers complained
by letter, and only by good luck was it possible
to avert several tragedies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it had been as bad as that,&rdquo;
Bob commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had,&rdquo; Barney nodded. &ldquo;We wanted you
three boys to start in with open minds. Remember?
We didn&rsquo;t tell you details; but now it&rsquo;s
gone too far for taking things easy. We&rsquo;ve got
to get to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; agreed the detective. &ldquo;The third
point we know is that Mr. Tredway was very
anxious to hold up the good name of his corporation,
and that he decided to take this last
ship to its owner in person, after Lang, here,
gave it&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, noticing Bob&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s on your mind,&rdquo; Langley said,
turning to his younger cousin. &ldquo;I was the one
who tested and checked that Silver Flash. I
said she was O.K. before the take-off. But,&rdquo; his
manner was defensive, &ldquo;if you think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; Bob asserted. &ldquo;For a minute
I did&mdash;but Mr.&mdash;but Barney says not a thing
was wrong about the Silver Flash. So, of
course, there&rsquo;s nothing to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Barney, &ldquo;we none of us knew
it would be the Silver Flash. The buyer couldn&rsquo;t
make up his mind, till almost the last minute,
about that pair of twins. One time he&rsquo;d come
and say he liked the silver, then he wanted the
copper-gold finish. Both crates were identical
except for that. I thought, myself, he was going
to take&mdash;well, we all thought the last time he
came he wanted the gold one. But I guess he
telegraphed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, that explains one thing,&rdquo; said
Bob. &ldquo;If everybody thought he wanted the
Golden Dart, that&rsquo;s why the rudder rope was
frayed off in that ship.&rdquo; Barney, who had been
told everything, nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but that don&rsquo;t explain
why the other ship&mdash;sound and perfect&mdash;crashed.
Unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless&mdash;what?&rdquo; Bob, Lang and the detective
were interested, but Bob voiced the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless Mr. Tredway did it on purpose&mdash;crashed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>To Mr. Wright&rsquo;s quiet inquiry Barney answered
readily enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I run the plant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The deep part
of the money end, and all that is none of my
business. But I happen to know there&rsquo;s some
trouble about money, or losses, or something
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Wright bent forward,
&ldquo;&mdash;Tredway, because he was in some financial
difficulty, or deeper trouble, might have done
away with himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; defensively Barney replied, &ldquo;how else
do you account for a diving ship, placed so careful,
on the lakeside, close to shore, and only
damaged as little as possible, and then not from
anything being wrong in her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob saw that his father was very thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he ran off and hid, afterward?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t find hide nor hair of him, did
they? Dredging, or searching didn&rsquo;t locate anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; the detective objected, &ldquo;that
doesn&rsquo;t explain about the frayed cable, or the
other things done to airplanes to damage the
reputation of the corporation; that is my theory
about the motive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Barney admitted. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a
theory about the motive for damage to crates,
maybe you&rsquo;ve got one about the whole affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Father?&rdquo; Bob was eager to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three crimes to investigate,&rdquo; Mr.
Wright said slowly. &ldquo;The accidents, the thefts,
and the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still think Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s disappearance
was due to a crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lang, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of crime? Nothing is wrong with
the ship he used, Barney says,&rdquo; objected Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very strange one,&rdquo; his father replied. &ldquo;Remember&mdash;there
was a brown airplane hidden in
a field. It was gone&mdash;before the accident. My
theory is that either some one he feared, or
some one who hated him, took off in that brown
airplane, overtook or waited for Mr. Tredway&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rode him down!&rdquo; gasped Barney. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
thought of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed the detective, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s drop all
worry about the less important thefts, the deliberate
damage to the airplanes&mdash;and look for
the man who flew that brown airplane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob asked it as a question, then he repeated
it as an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE SKY SQUAD DISOBEYS</span></h2>
<p>Both Curt and Al listened eagerly while Bob
related the details of the Sunday conference
with the detective.</p>
<p>He gave them the information imparted by
Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing wrong with the Silver Flash?&rdquo;
repeated Al. &ldquo;Then that brown crate must have
driven it down&mdash;but why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some revengeful pilot Mr. Tredway
had discharged,&rdquo; suggested Curt. &ldquo;At any rate
there must have been some motive to make a
man do anything as terrible as that. But how
are we going to locate the brown ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have that message we discovered on
the seat, and then picked up in the dewy grass.&rdquo;
Al produced it, dry but smudged and crumpled,
from his pocket card and identification case.
&ldquo;We might compare the writing with the&mdash;well,
say with the books in the aircraft plant, and
with everybody&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lang didn&rsquo;t get any information when we
made inquiries about the brown craft at the
nearest airport, did he?&rdquo; Lang, who was quite
affable and good-humored, with Griff and his
actions forgotten in the new search, answered
Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing more than you did. They&rsquo;d
never heard of the ship I described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> have got me more puzzled than this
whole mystery has,&rdquo; Al said, grinning. &ldquo;Lang,
the way Bob tells it, you must have been next
door to ordering the undertaker, and then you
were flying, stunting, as if you&rsquo;d never eaten
fish and ice-cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s psychologically explainable,&rdquo; Lang
liked to use long words, to indicate his superiority.
&ldquo;Under the stimulus of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; Al threw up his hands as if to
ward off a flow of words too long for his youthful
understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too easy to explain,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;Father
said Lang got so excited that he forgot to think
about himself, and &lsquo;Nature took its course&rsquo; when
he stopped worrying about his fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was it,&rdquo; agreed Lang. &ldquo;I accepted the
idea, from somewhere, that ice-cream and fish
made poison, and while I was flying, when a
little gas began to bother me I got scared, and
the scare did the rest. Uncle said that half our
pains are due to believing what other folks tell
us can happen; the rest is from being afraid
it is happening to us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;That clears it up.&rdquo; Al became very sober. &ldquo;I
wish the disappearance of Mr. Tredway was as
easy to settle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to find that mysterious
brown &rsquo;plane, or get hold of somebody who saw
it flying, to tell us which way it went.&rdquo; Lang
rose, stretched, yawning, and sauntered off
toward his wheel; the other three, sitting on the
cottage porch before supper, for which Lang
would not stay, looked after him in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think?&rdquo; Curt broke the
thoughtful pause. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to criticise,
and I don&rsquo;t want you fellows to get angry, but
I have a feeling that Uncle Fred is wrong to
have us drop all our suspicions and try to find a
crate that could be five hundred miles away, in
any direction. My theory is that if we locate
the airplane it will be by &lsquo;luck&rsquo; and I don&rsquo;t
believe in &lsquo;luck&rsquo; because if you think &lsquo;luck&rsquo; is
going to help, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything
yourself, and if you believe it is going to hinder,
there&rsquo;s no use in doing anything. So,&rdquo; he
grinned, &ldquo;I believe that everything comes out
right only when we do everything we can to
make it so&mdash;and as long as there isn&rsquo;t any way
to start hunting that brown crate, let&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disobey?&rdquo; asked Bob, rather surprised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it would amount to that&mdash;and in another
way it wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it if it didn&rsquo;t and why wouldn&rsquo;t
it if it did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others laughed at Al&rsquo;s twisted inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Fred didn&rsquo;t give you orders to &lsquo;lay
off&rsquo; watching, did he, Bob?&rdquo; and as Bob shook
his head, &ldquo;He only meant for us to concentrate
on seeing if we could pick up a clue to the mysterious
&rsquo;plane. Well, I feel that by finding out
what Griff is doing, and why his father is so
fidgety and furtive, and the rest of the puzzles
here, we may be led to that &rsquo;plane, or get a clue
to it or to its pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any disobedience in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Curt answered Bob, &ldquo;the way I look
at it, if Uncle Fred took us into the case he expected
us to obey the &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; of the orders he
gave, and he did say to forget the smaller things
here and work on locating the &rsquo;plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; agreed Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty deep&mdash;what
Lang would call, ethical problem. Father
meant to leave Griff alone, unless he did something
actually incriminating, and to put all our
effort on the other thing. Let&rsquo;s see your paper,
Al.&rdquo; He held out his hand for the brief note
Al had preserved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Study it as they would, they got nothing helpful
from the grass-stained paper with the
smudged writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s think who we&rsquo;ve seen use an indelible
pencil,&rdquo; hinted Al. &ldquo;Remember, the morning
we found this, we decided, in a joke, that there
were too many indelible pencils to try to trace
the writer because he used one; but how many
people close to this mystery have you seen using
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clerk in the supply room!&rdquo; gasped Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bob&mdash;because he takes a copy of every
order he writes and of every requisition, on an
old-fashioned letter press, the same way they
put their copying ribbon letters in between a
damp cloth and a soft, thin sheet of the big
book, put it all in the press and make the copying
ribbon print the letter into the book instead
of using carbon paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have a clue! How does the clerk&rsquo;s
writing compare with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the three having spoken in turn, by
common consent they agreed to Al&rsquo;s impulsive
suggestion. They were hardly able to wait for
their supper; however, they put it away with
speed if not with the best of table manners and
secured their bicycles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>It took them only a short time to reach the
aircraft plant.</p>
<p>The watchman accepted their explanation
that they were passing and wanted to borrow
several books from Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s reference
library, in the offices.</p>
<p>Bob, accordingly, went to the offices, while
Curt and Al strolled, with apparent aimlessness,
across the inner quadrangle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light in one window&mdash;no, in two
windows&mdash;already!&rdquo; Al mentioned. &ldquo;I wonder
who&rsquo;s here, at night again.&rdquo; Almost at once he
suggested that they go and see.</p>
<p>Curt, himself fired by the curiosity of his companion,
hurried after Al.</p>
<p>They saw Bob, who had lighted the outer office
electric bulbs, choosing several volumes from a
shelf, to carry out in truth their explanation to
the watchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; Bob said, joining the
others at the door as he put out the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be Barney&mdash;unless he came back&mdash;no,
the cabin &rsquo;plane isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Al argued. &ldquo;Anyway,
Barney stayed over to transact some business,
you said, Bob. Must be either&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Griff, or Griff and his father&mdash;or Mr. Parsons
and somebody else,&rdquo; Curt said breathlessly,
excited. &ldquo;There were two separate offices
lighted, and you can see the door glass shining.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;The doors are shut, though,&rdquo; Al spoke, disappointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Curt, &ldquo;but one of us can
hide in the alcove where the water cooler and
door to the washroom are located. If anybody
comes, it would be easy to dodge on into the
washroom and no one would ask questions about
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re elected!&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;I want to
go with Al, because I think I know where to
find the latest letter-book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the reference volumes tucked under his
arm he led Al down the dim corridor, while Curt
secured a good place in the niche by the water
cooler to watch from.</p>
<p>As the two brothers went down the steps, at
the rear, toward the supply room, to be sure
that no one was there and likely to come up
and catch them, Al&rsquo;s grip on Bob&rsquo;s arm tightened
convulsively.</p>
<p>Some one was coming down the steps behind
them.</p>
<p>With lips close to Al&rsquo;s ear, Bob whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiptoe! Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led Al down to the lowest steps, and there,
just beside the door to the supply room the
brothers flattened themselves against the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>They held their breath. They made themselves
as small as they could. A quick tread came
on down the steps, there was the pause of a
body close&mdash;almost touching them. Breathing,
sharp, short, quick, carried to their ears; but
they kept mouse-still. The door opened.</p>
<p>A light flared up as Bob dragged Al back out
of range. But as they turned and stared down,
hearts still pounding from the excitement of the
narrow escape, both brothers gasped.</p>
<p>In the light below, stood&mdash;a bearded stranger!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">A TRIPLE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Pulling Al further back out of the light,
around the little dark jog beside the door jamb
of the supply room, Bob put his lips close to his
brother&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; he whispered, hardly loud enough
for Al to hear.</p>
<p>With a little squeeze to reassure his brother,
Bob let go of Al&rsquo;s arm and tiptoed back up the
stairway, carefully clinging to the side wall and
hoping that this precaution would enable him to
get away without causing the steps to creak.</p>
<p>He was successful. Al, noting that the man
inside the room seemed to be doing nothing
more than standing there considering the layout
of the place, guessed that Bob wanted to
consult with Curt, watching upstairs. Al felt
important: he was in the very heart of mystery,
and much depended on him. Therefore he
watched with every faculty alert as the man
turned his head this way and that, apparently
inspecting the stock of wing and fuselage cloth,
the boxed instruments, the cases of &ldquo;dope&rdquo; for
varnishing bodies and wings, the many other
visible objects held in reserve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Bob, slipping along the hallway at the top of
the steps, noticed that both offices were lighted
still, that both doors were closed, and as far as
he could see, nothing had changed up above.</p>
<p>Curt was still watching. He was practically
invisible in his nook by the water cooler. Bob,
with a small word under his breath, reassured
his comrade who came out of hiding as soon as
he knew that the footsteps he heard approaching
were Bob&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did the stranger come from?&rdquo; asked
Bob softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger?&rdquo; Curt&rsquo;s voice betrayed amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who came down to the supply
room!&rdquo; Bob was also surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a stranger?&rdquo; Curt asked. &ldquo;I thought
it was Mr. Parsons. He came out of that dark
directors&rsquo; room, beyond me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Bob clutched Curt&rsquo;s arm in a tight
grip. &ldquo;Have you used your eyes, Curt, in daylight?
If you have, you recall that there is a
fire escape running up the side of the building&mdash;and
the landing is by that directors&rsquo; meeting
room window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so? Then, if that window is open&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The opening of one of the lighted offices
startled them, ended the consultation. Both
comrades, tense, drew close against the wall
behind the water cooler. If anybody was
thirsty!&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The lighted square of that door went black.
Someone had put out the dome light. Footsteps
went carelessly along the corridor from
the hiding youths, toward the front stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must follow&mdash;whoever it is!&rdquo; whispered
Bob. &ldquo;Curt, watch here. Al will watch that
other man. It&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A triple trail!&rdquo; gasped Curt. &ldquo;Go on, Bob.
Be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob agreed and tiptoed along to the stairway.
By the time he got there he had no need for
special caution, the lower door was closing.</p>
<p>Bob ran lightly down the stairs, crossed the
entry below, cautiously peered into the yard,
lighter just there by the arc over the office building
doorway, and nodded to himself.</p>
<p>Griff was passing around the side of the
building!</p>
<p>Cautiously Bob trailed him, allowing the partner&rsquo;s
son to get out of sight beyond the turn
before he left the doorway.</p>
<p>Where was Griff bound? The main gates were
across the yard and, as Bob knew, they were
locked while the night man made his rounds of
inspection among hangars and plant structures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>While Al watched his man in the supply room,
while Curt hid, watching the lighted office door,
Bob wondered what Griff was about. The young
man did not go anywhere near or bend his steps
in the direction of the main entrance but turned,
with Bob carefully watching as he clung close
in the shadow of the office structure, and went
on around the building toward the private exit
used by the officials. Being the son of Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s
partner, Griff had a key; but Bob could
see, as he peered around the building, that the
gate stood slightly ajar already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he go on home?&rdquo; Bob wondered. &ldquo;Had
I better go back to Al?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thought was answered by Griff&rsquo;s actions.
He paused at the gate, seeming to inspect it.
He was surprised to find it ajar, Bob decided.
He held his place close to the office shadow and
watched, as Griff looked around, inside and outside
the fence.</p>
<p>Then, as though discovering something, Griff
ran out of sight, leaving the gate as he had
found it.</p>
<p>Instantly Bob ran across the small open space
to the gate. There, in sudden caution, he
cuddled his body close to the fence; it had just
crossed his mind that Griff might have gone
outside in a pretended hurry to draw out any
pursuer; he might be hiding, watching!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>He was not, however.</p>
<p>The sputter and roar of a motor startled Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; Bob mused, while he projected
his head through the gateway. Almost
in the same instant that he saw Griff starting up
a motorcycle, Bob saw Griff shut off the motor
and trundle the machine away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His own motorcycle is broken, since Saturday&rsquo;s
accident,&rdquo; Bob reflected. &ldquo;Now he must
have brought another one. He meant to ride off
in a hurry,&rdquo; he deduced, &ldquo;but he decided the
noise would startle and warn people, so he&rsquo;s going
further away before he starts up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly his own action was decided upon.
He streaked back across the yard, around the
hangars, to get his own bicycle. Against a
speedy motor it would not keep Griff in sight,
but it would enable Bob to get over the ground
faster, and, if Griff did not go home, Bob meant
to pursue him, making careful inquiries as he
pedaled. There was only the crossroad for him
to take, and Bob could see it from the highway.</p>
<p>In a very short time, and without having been
seen by the watchman, Bob was out on the road.
The distant sputter of the motorcycle engine
and a speeding form passing the junction of
the crossroads gave Bob all the information he
needed. Without wasting energy in an effort to
keep the flying cycle in sight, he pedaled after it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The sudden sharp noise evidently startled
others besides Bob.</p>
<p>Al, watching, saw the man who was evidently
making some notes in the supply room, suddenly
dash to the switch. Out went the light.</p>
<p>Al heard the scrape and rumble of a window
being unfastened and thrown up. The man was
listening, he judged.</p>
<p>Curt, by the water cooler, heard nothing but
the faint sounds of the motor; at first he
thought they were shots. When he saw the office
light go out suddenly, immediately afterward, he
thought someone in there had shot at some one
else; but the door was flung open and he heard
hurried feet pounding along the hall and almost
stumbling down the front steps, careless of how
much noise they made.</p>
<p>Curt could not go to explain to Al. He must
see who that was going out of the quickly darkened
office so swiftly.</p>
<p>Al needed no one to warn him. He crouched,
tense and listening intently, outside the supply
room door for a full minute. Absolute, torturing
silence began to twitch his nerves. Nameless
fears and countless uncertainties filled his
mind. Was the man stalking him? Was he there
at all? Had he ever been there? Was he human&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Al heard a queer sound; at once he identified
it. The window was being quietly pulled down.</p>
<p>Again he listened, watched, waited.</p>
<p>Curt, slipping down the banisters in the good,
old-fashioned, speedy boys&rsquo; way, landed quietly
at the foot of the stairs soon after the front
doors of the office building closed.</p>
<p>But by that time whoever had emerged was
far across the quadrangle and it was too dark
to recognize him. There came the flare of the
headlights of an automobile.</p>
<p>From its position on the grounds and from
the style of its lamps, Curt guessed it was the
runabout used by Mr. Parsons, Tredway&rsquo;s remaining
partner. What was he doing here?
Where was he going? Curt, in the office doorway,
not daring to emerge because of the beams
of light that might swing around the yard at
any moment, heard the voice of Parsons hailing
the watchman, questioning him. The other
replied in a way to show he had not heard any
noises, could not account for them.</p>
<p>Curt, as the car got under way and the main
gate was flung wide to permit it to depart, raced
around the office building &ldquo;ell&rdquo; and across to
his bicycle. He knew he could not pursue, but
the wheel would give an excuse for emerging
from that gate at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he called to the watchman, pedaling
swiftly across to him. &ldquo;I guess he forgot I was
here,&rdquo; pretending that Mr. Parsons sponsored
his presence there so late at night. The watchman
said nothing but held the gates open until
Curt pedaled through and took his way after
the car, not to keep it in sight but to see if it
went to its owner&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Al, ignorant that he was the only remaining
member of the Sky Squad, watched tensely and
listened alertly beside the supply room door.
He heard nothing. Cautiously he protruded his
head around the door jamb.</p>
<p>The room was silent, evidently the man was
hiding or&mdash;&ldquo;gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&mdash;where&mdash;could he go?&rdquo; Al answered
his own questions at once, for the window,
made of tiny panes of thick glass between
heavy bars, locked always from inside, impossible
to open from outside, was not tightly shut.</p>
<p>For once in his life Al paused to think before
he acted.</p>
<p>That window was not tightly shut. He had
heard it opened, and&mdash;closed. But if the man
had closed it from within the room he would
have pulled it down tightly. He had not done
so. He had left it partly open&mdash;why? To provide
a way to come back, Al decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Almost at the same instant it flashed into his
head that if he were to be caught in that room,
with its door unfastened, he would be accused
by any of the plant members, the watchman or
those he thought were still in the upstairs offices,
of stealing whatever might be missing.</p>
<p>He had a plan, at once!</p>
<p>He tiptoed back to the steps, listening. No
sound came to him. Softly he went into the
open doorway, made sure the window was not
tightly shut, by inspecting the lighter space beneath
it, then very quietly let the door go shut,
allowing its spring lock to snap. He could open
it from inside if he had to escape. No one without
a key could open it from the hallway.</p>
<p>Then he ran close to the window, peered out,
listened with an ear to the crack beneath the
lower panes.</p>
<p>Nothing was stirring. But from the window
he could see the gate, and the light was sufficient
to show him a man&rsquo;s form arriving there.</p>
<p>Evidently the form stopped from surprise or
caution, then it went swiftly out. Al, forgetting
fear, flung the window slightly upward,
edged out, dropped to the ground, reached up
and almost closed the window, then fully drew
it down with a little slam, and raced to the gate.
There he paused, peering out carefully.</p>
<p>Down the narrow lane he saw a man&rsquo;s form
trudging rapidly.</p>
<p>The third trail was opened!</p>
<p>After the man, at a distance, trudged Al!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">THE &ldquo;WINDSOCK&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>For Al the trail ended abruptly after a walk
of a mile. The stranger, whose face, with its
heavy beard, Al could not dare get close enough
to identify&mdash;even if he knew it!&mdash;hailed a passing
automobile, asked for a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; and was taken
in. That concluded Al&rsquo;s chances of following
because no other car came along. Dejectedly
he returned to the aircraft plant to discover that
some one, perhaps the watchman, had closed the
gate. There was nothing left for him to do but
to go to the main gate, call the attendant and
get his bicycle. His friends were gone, the man
assured him, and Al had no excuse to stay there.</p>
<p>Dejectedly, feeling that he had been close to
a clue and that it had slipped through his hands
by his &ldquo;bad break,&rdquo; Al rode home.</p>
<p>Curt&rsquo;s trail took him, eventually, to the Parsons
cottage. Seeing the car drawn up before
the garage, Curt decided that he had no need
to watch the car being put into the garage; evidently
its driver had gone into his home for
a moment first. Curt rode away. Had he waited
his trail would have led further; but he did not
guess that!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Bob had better fortune.</p>
<p>He saved his strength as he pedaled along,
well ahead of his two less fortunate trailmates,
and when he came to a cross street of the
suburbs where a policeman was directing traffic
Bob drew up beside the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bob!&rdquo; the policeman hailed. &ldquo;Out sort
of late, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. O&rsquo;Brien. I stayed at the plant&mdash;I&rsquo;m
learning how they put airplanes together at
the Tredway plant. I wanted to ask if you noticed
a motorcycle, not long ago&mdash;maybe fifteen
minutes&mdash;a friend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the officer, starting the cars down the
street by a wave of his hand, did not wait for
an explanation of Bob&rsquo;s reason for the question,
&ldquo;Griff Parsons rode by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who I mean. Did he turn off, here,
to go home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob knew that Griff&rsquo;s house was several
blocks over, on an up-and-down street that was
&ldquo;one way&rdquo; for traffic. If Griff had turned here
Bob&rsquo;s quest, he knew, was over; if he did not,
Griff would be gone much further, because if he
did not turn here, and thus enter his own home
street in the right direction he surely would not
go on and approach it in the wrong way, against
the traffic rules.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;He rode on by, just waved to me,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien
said, and turned to signal a warning to a car
that was trying to slip past the stoplights.</p>
<p>Thanking him Bob rode on. Griff must be
going somewhere!</p>
<p>The highway had no turns, except the suburb&rsquo;s
cross streets. It was possible that Griff
might have turned into one of them, perhaps to
return a hired motorcycle to its garage; nevertheless,
so strange had been the action of the
youth that Bob decided to ride on, at least to the
last police officer along the main traffic road,
to see if he could learn whether the trail continued
or not.</p>
<p>The traffic officer, used to seeing this rider,
greeted Bob and told him that several motorcycles
had passed him. Bob, riding to the curb
to rest, was puzzled. Had one of those been the
motorcycle he had followed?</p>
<p>A thought caused him to ride on.</p>
<p>Griff, Bob knew, from his own inquiries,
&ldquo;hung out&rdquo; with quite a rough crowd of youths;
they had very little reputation in the suburb,
and one of their haunts, near Rocky Lake, came
to Bob&rsquo;s mind. Griff, riding his motorcycle,
might have gone on to the inn or roadhouse or
&ldquo;speakeasy&rdquo; or whatever it was, near the picnic
grounds at Rocky Lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Tired, but determined, Bob went on.</p>
<p>Some time later he approached the gayly
lighted roadhouse.</p>
<p>He smiled to himself as he observed the name
of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Windsock!&rdquo; it was called.</p>
<p>On roadside signs, down the road in both directions,
were admonitions to automobilists to
&ldquo;set down at The Windsock,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fly past
The Windsock,&rdquo; and such tempting notices.</p>
<p>A windsock, Bob knew, was the cornucopia
of doped cloth, closed at one end and held open
at the other by a metal ring, which was fastened
in a prominent, high position at every flying
field and airport, to be filled by the draft of a
breeze and thus, by its position, to indicate to
flying craft which direction to &ldquo;head in&rdquo; or to
&ldquo;take off.&rdquo; Since an airplane is much easier to
get off the ground, and back to earth, headed
into the wind, the &ldquo;windsock&rdquo; was a most important
adjunct to every field; and Bob knew
that the name, and the symbol, a real windsock
on top of the inn, had been chosen by its owner
because he had been an ex-pilot who put his
money into the hotel venture and tried to attract
picnickers, automobile parties and other
patrons of a less savory nature by the novel idea
of having his dining alcoves built to resemble the
cozy little cabins of airplanes and had his meals
served by girls clad in suits and helmets resembling
those worn by pilots. Also, he had
let it be rumored around town that he chose the
flying symbol and the aviation idea because, in
his inn, &ldquo;the sky is the limit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Bob, approaching, was surprised to see the
very motorcycle&mdash;he was sure of that!&mdash;he had
followed, leaned against a post in the parking
yard, and he felt certain that his long ride had
not been wasted.</p>
<p>Where was Griff? Bob wondered. He hoped
there would be some way for him to discover
the whereabouts of the youth.</p>
<p>Not wishing to walk into the place for fear he
might disclose his presence to Griff, Bob skirted
the building, unobserved.</p>
<p>From an open window at the side came voices
in angry altercation.</p>
<p>Bob did not need to get within sight of the
occupants: he recognized Griff&rsquo;s loud, sharp,
furious tones. What was he saying?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;all I could scrape together&mdash;I <i>did</i> put it
in that package, I keep telling you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bologna! Rats! It was wads of paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was money! I want my receipt! If&mdash;if
you don&rsquo;t!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;If <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t, you better say. If you don&rsquo;t
come through&mdash;by this time tomorrow night&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
ask your old man for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>Bob did not dare creep any closer. They
might look out of the window. Some payment
had been made, by Griff&rsquo;s claim. By the denial
of the other man it had not been made. By his
threat it must be made.</p>
<p>Bob hesitated&mdash;and while he stood, undecided,
the roar of a car, coming at full speed, came
to his ears.</p>
<p>He glanced down the road. Hardly had he
located the direction when he recognized the car.
It contained&mdash;Mr. Parsons!</p>
<p>A man&rsquo;s head leaned out of the open window.
To Bob, as he crouched back into some ornamental
shrubbery, the face was unfamiliar; but
he saw it was brutish, fierce, angry&mdash;and he impressed
it on his memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your pop, now,&rdquo; the man called&mdash;and
then he gave an exclamation that Bob
could not comprehend. Presently the light went
out&mdash;and, almost at the same time, while Parsons
alighted in the parking place, Bob, near
the rear corner of the building, saw a form
emerge from the kitchens and race away down
the yard toward the grove beyond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Griff!&rdquo; muttered Bob to himself. &ldquo;Griff&mdash;running
tight as he can go&mdash;running away from
his father&mdash;to hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watching, more interested in the new arrival
than in the son, Bob remained in concealment.
But his mind was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;Why&mdash;and what
next?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;THE CASE IS &lsquo;SEWED UP&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Sitting on the Wright porch, early the next
morning, Curt and Al listened eagerly to Bob&rsquo;s
recital of the past night&rsquo;s events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Griff ran off&mdash;what, then?&rdquo; Al demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A taxi came racing along and stopped at
The Windsock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could I do, except keep hidden and
watch?&rdquo; Curt&rsquo;s question brought the counter-question
from Bob. &ldquo;The taxi door opened&mdash;and
who do you suppose jumped out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Curt and Al spoke at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very man Al and I saw in the supply
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him hail the taxi,&rdquo; Al exclaimed.
&ldquo;Everything is beginning to fit together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; Bob agreed, &ldquo;and, what&rsquo;s more,
it fits tightly. As soon as the stranger paid his
fare he recognized Mr. Parsons who was halted
on the roadhouse veranda, watching. They began
to talk, and stood there for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;They knew each other!&rdquo; Curt exclaimed.
&ldquo;They must be working together to loot the
supply room. That&rsquo;s probably how the mystery
man got in: he had a key from Mr. Parsons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like that,&rdquo; admitted Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; Al wanted the story. &ldquo;Did
they find Griff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but the stranger saw his motorcycle.
He got awfully excited about it and he went
with Mr. Parsons to look at it. They went close
to where I was hiding back of the shrubs, but
they didn&rsquo;t say anything until they were close
to the motorcycle. They were too far away for
me to hear, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have crept closer,&rdquo; declared Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes! You would!&rdquo; Bob was scornful.
&ldquo;Right out across an open yard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al subsided, crestfallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; Curt asked quickly, to avoid
any quarrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talked for about ten minutes&mdash;then the
man made some notes of things Mr. Parsons
said&mdash;I wish I could have heard! Then he
hopped onto his motorcycle and rode off, and
Mr. Parsons stood thinking for awhile and
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Don&rsquo;t keep us waiting. What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curt&mdash;he turned the car and went back
toward town!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t look for Griff?&rdquo; Al had recovered
his usual interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! He drove away. Griff must have been
watching, too. He came out, and shook his fist
toward the roadhouse and then walked off, and&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They discussed the incidents of the past night,
coupling them with the strange actions and uneasiness
of Mr. Parsons and of Griff on former
occasions, riding, as they talked, toward the
plant.</p>
<p>Barney&rsquo;s cabin airplane was again on the
field, and as soon as they arrived and he saw
them, from an office window, Barney summoned
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he greeted them, closing the door,
&ldquo;how goes the study of airplane building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know how they lay down the framework
for the fuselage and how careful they are
to see that every longeron and brace and strut
and guywire and turnbuckle fits exactly in place
and is well fastened,&rdquo; Al exclaimed. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve
helped put on the wings and the tail assembly,
and Bob is going to help install an engine, today,
and we will watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob laughed and Curt joined him. They saw
the amused light in Barney&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you asked!&rdquo; Al defended his enthusiasm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a &lsquo;polite opening&rsquo;,&rdquo; Bob grinned.
&ldquo;Barney wants to know about&mdash;other things
we&rsquo;ve learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interrupting one another, they gave him the
details of their experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m! Well!&rdquo; Barney&rsquo;s face became very
serious. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barney smiled at Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The partner and his son are working with
an outsider. I thought so. But what about the
brown &rsquo;plane? Any news of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left it out entirely,&rdquo; Bob said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We disobeyed Uncle,&rdquo; Curt admitted. &ldquo;Bob
said Uncle wanted us to drop things here and
concentrate on trying to find the brown &rsquo;plane,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find that &lsquo;crate&rsquo; I feel sure.&rdquo; Bob
was earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only that, but if a crime is being committed
under your nose you won&rsquo;t go off looking
for something else to do while it is going on,
will you?&rdquo; Al wanted their course confirmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did just right,&rdquo; Barney commended
them. &ldquo;You lads stick to this end of it. I&rsquo;ve
suspected that Parsons and his son were &lsquo;up to&rsquo;
something, and I don&rsquo;t agree with your father,
Bob, about the brown crate at all! I think you
fellows deserve a &lsquo;raise&rsquo; and if you can only
catch one or all of the crowd doing something&mdash;catch
them &lsquo;red-handed&rsquo; in a way of speaking,
I&rsquo;ll hand out a little private reward. I feel that
it&rsquo;s due to&mdash;to the memory of Mr. Tredway.
He was mighty good to me and&mdash;and I want to&mdash;get
everything cleared up here, because I
think the ones who have been doing wrong right
here at the plant got found out by him and they
either hired that airplane from some distant
place and flew out and rode down Tredway or
else they paid some unscrupulous pilot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused as he saw Al squirming in his
chair with eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Al?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unscrupulous pilot!&rdquo; reiterated Al. &ldquo;Why&mdash;the
man at The Windsock is a&mdash;an ex-pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be! That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; Barney nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, from what I saw of him, his face shows
that he&rsquo;s unscrupulous,&rdquo; added Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me, from here,&rdquo; Barney said,
slowly, &ldquo;it looks to me as though we&rsquo;ve got the
case &lsquo;sewed up.&rsquo; All you need to do is to find
out, some way, about that ex-pilot&mdash;what he
does with his time, if he owns a crate yet, and
so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barney turned to Curt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he nodded, &ldquo;that ex-pilot might
know a lot about a brown &rsquo;plane, and about what
it did to force another one down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have got the case &lsquo;sewed up&rsquo;,&rdquo; Al
declared. &ldquo;We came here last night to see if we
could compare a little scrap of writing we found
where the &lsquo;plane had been, with the books of
letters and things to see if the writing agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had no time to find anything,&rdquo; Curt admitted.
&ldquo;The other things came up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see that note? Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al produced the much-folded, dirty scrap and
handed it to Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he shook his head after a careful study.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t recognize it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The supply clerk?&rdquo; hinted Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all like his writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Curt, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s done with an indelible
pencil. Now that we know the ex-pilot is under
suspicion, we can find out if he has an indelible
pencil that he carries around&mdash;or, he might destroy
it, considering what has happened since
the note was written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who&rsquo;s the note written to?&rdquo; asked Bob.
&ldquo;It says &lsquo;everything O.K.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whoever hired him. To Parsons, maybe&mdash;or
to Griff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; Bob became very thoughtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to get a sample of the ex-pilot&rsquo;s
handwriting,&rdquo; suggested Al, eagerly. &ldquo;Shall I?
I can try! They don&rsquo;t know me out at The
Windsock. Couldn&rsquo;t I take my autograph album&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make inquiries about the brown &lsquo;plane,
from around The Windsock,&rdquo; added Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can keep tabs at this end,&rdquo; argued
Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; agreed Barney. &ldquo;Fine! Yes, sir!
Boys&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got the case &lsquo;sewed up&rsquo; or circumstantial
evidence never pointed true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Dad, again?&rdquo; asked Bob as they
rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he&rsquo;s awfully busy on that other
case. He must trust you fellows pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Al swelled with pride, &ldquo;maybe we&rsquo;ve
disobeyed orders, but if this comes out as good
as we think it will, we&rsquo;ll have no trouble making
Father see that he was wrong and we were right
to disobey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; agreed Barney.</p>
<p>Griff seemed to be getting ready to work himself
into danger for their special benefit, it
seemed to Bob in the engine assembling rooms.
The youth was angry, upset, uneasy, fidgety; he
hurried out when he heard his father&rsquo;s voice
approaching down the hall and the older man
betrayed as much uneasiness and concern as did
his son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>But that night, when they thought they had
the last stitches taken to &ldquo;sew up&rdquo; the case,
as Barney said, Fate ripped out the whole thing&mdash;and
they were left without a thread of a
clue!&mdash;until the unexpected thing happened that
gave Bob his &ldquo;hunch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">A NEW MYSTERY</span></h2>
<p>Cheerfully Al greeted the rigger for whom
he worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney&mdash;Mr. Horton&mdash;&rdquo; he corrected his
own familiar allusion to the manager of the aircraft
plant, &ldquo;&mdash;says please hurry the work on
this sport biplane. The man who&rsquo;s buying it
is in a big hurry. He wants to get into some
race with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo; the rigger grumbled a little.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in a hurry. But I don&rsquo;t rush my
part of it for anybody. There&rsquo;s been enough
complaint about this plant, already, without me
doing anything to cut down the performance of
a crate by skimping my share of the high standards
Mr. Tredway always kept up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; agreed Al, &ldquo;but he meant to do all
you can, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the rigger was in a complaining mood,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all very well. But did he say why they&rsquo;re
giving us cheaper stuff to work with, since the
real boss&mdash;went West, maybe!&mdash;did they tell
you why that is, that we&rsquo;re getting cheaper
stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Al admitted, &ldquo;but I do know that Mr.
Parsons and Bar&mdash;and Mr. Horton were talking
about some complaint from the wing assembling
room, about poor fabric. They almost quarreled.
Barney told Mr. Parsons it had to stop,
he was going to uphold Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s ideas,
and Mr. Parsons said so was he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody&rsquo;s ordering cheap stuff. Look
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked up a turnbuckle, a metal object in
which the threads of each wire end were so
threaded in that when the ends of wires were
screwed in, the turning of the central, revolving
part either drew the two sections of wire close,
making it taut, or allowed them to recede a little
from one another, for more looseness&mdash;by
which the flying and landing wires, and other
parts of the guying rig were adjusted.</p>
<p>The turnbuckle looked all right to Al and he
said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shows how much you know,&rdquo; scoffed the rigger,
Sandy. &ldquo;Look here&mdash;heft this&mdash;and then
this one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He selected another turnbuckle, handed both
to Al, and the youth &ldquo;weighted them&rdquo; in his two
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one does feel heavier.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it does! It&rsquo;s a cheap casting, not
the aluminum alloy the other one is machined
from. Why, them threads on the new one will
wear and go bad in no time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al, watching, observed that as the rigger
manipulated a pocket knife in the threaded end
of the part, bright metal and a worn look were
almost immediately evident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sandy Jim agreed with his discovery,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been talking around and others is dissatisfied&mdash;in
the dope room, in the engine room.
Everywheres!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when Mr. Parsons talked with the manager,&rdquo;
Al explained, &ldquo;they had the supply clerk
in and went over the orders and way-bills and
delivery check-up, and everything was all right.
The orders went to the same firms, as always&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting shoddy stuff, all the same!&rdquo;
grunted Jim. &ldquo;What good is it to rush out a
&lsquo;job&rsquo; and have it accepted on the reputation of
Mr. Tredway, and then have complaints in a
few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Al, and changed the subject.
&ldquo;Mr. Horton says you&rsquo;ll have to excuse
me, this morning. He&rsquo;s sending me out on an
errand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo; Jim snapped. &ldquo;Wants this job
rushed, and takes away my helper! Whyn&rsquo;t he
use his office boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al could not explain that it was Barney&rsquo;s
way of releasing him so he could go to The
Windsock for that comparison of the ex-pilot&rsquo;s
autograph with the clue note Al held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll have to ask him,&rdquo; Al grinned,
and went over to get his bicycle. Sandy Jim
followed him, dragging a small parcel out of his
hip pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re riding,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;go
past the house and slip this in to Jimmy-junior.
It&rsquo;s some odds and ends of broken stuff for him
to use on his new model air-liner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to,&rdquo; Al took the parcel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back quick as you can,&rdquo; urged Sandy.
&ldquo;I need a good helper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al quickly sent his bicycle along the highway.
Stopping at Sandy&rsquo;s home he took as little time
as he could to drop the parcel, and to explain
to Jimmy-junior that the reason he had not yet
been taken into the Sky Squad was that they
had been too busy, evenings, to hold any meetings.</p>
<p>Then he made his way to the roadhouse near
Rocky Lake Park, and leaned his wheel against
the veranda supports.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mister Jones busy?&rdquo; he asked a sleepy
waiter who was listlessly dusting off some
chairs in one of the small compartments made
to look like the cabin of an air-liner. Al had
found it easy to learn the ex-pilot&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the office,&rdquo; the man jerked a thumb
toward a side room. Al, knocking at the door
and hearing a gruff voice bid him enter, went
into the same room Bob had described as the
scene of the quarrel between the roadhouse man
and Griff.</p>
<p>The man, looking up from some work at a
small desk, had a coarse, scowling face. No
wonder he was &ldquo;ex&rdquo; pilot, Al reflected, with a
face as brutish and a manner as unfriendly and
curt as &ldquo;Mr. Jones&rdquo; showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; Al stammered, not so much ill
at ease as trying to pretend he felt shy in the
presence of a great man, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of the fellows
who have a sort of club, to study airplanes,
and all that&mdash;and I&mdash;we&mdash;heard about you being
a clever pilot, and I thought I&rsquo;d ride out
and ask if you&rsquo;d be generous enough to write
a little something about aviation in our club
autograph album.&rdquo; He produced the small book
he had brought in his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m!&rdquo; The man scowled. &ldquo;Le&rsquo;me see that
book!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>He took the small volume and Al&rsquo;s heart sank.
Instead of writing sensibly and generously on
blank page invitingly offered, he flipped the
pages, and Al knew that the affair was a failure.
There was nothing about aviation in the
few autographed verses and sayings already collected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no aviation album!&rdquo; The man thrust
it away angrily and jumped up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
scheme, young fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scheme?&rdquo; Al tried to look innocent. &ldquo;I told
you&mdash;we want to get you to start the real autographs
from aviators!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subterfuge did not satisfy the man. He
frowned, stared at Al as though trying to get
through his guard, to discover any hidden motive.
Al, inexperienced, fidgeted, unable to conceal
his uneasiness.</p>
<p>However, he received a surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; The man snatched up the book.
&ldquo;Come to think of it, why not? Fact is, kid,
I&rsquo;ll start you off with <i>two</i> autographs. Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried out of the office. Al did not dare
&ldquo;peek&rdquo; to see where he went or what he did.
For all Al knew, the man might be just beyond
the side door, watching. He sat very still, trying
to be as self-possessed as he could.</p>
<p>Presently the man returned, with the book
held open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are!&rdquo; he said, affably. Al, glancing
at the book, saw that two opposite pages bore
fresh scrawls. The man waved a hand. &ldquo;Welcome.
Run along, now. We&rsquo;re busy, here&mdash;getting
set to open up a new &lsquo;airport&rsquo; out on the
side, where folks can dance to a fine orchestra
in a hangar. Tell any of your friends you like&mdash;especially
your parents. We got the prettiest
imitation of an airplane for the orchestra
to set in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al, hardly able to mumble his thanks, dashed
out to his bicycle. He could scarcely hold in his
impatience. One of those sets of rough characters
was written with a pencil, the other with
an indelible pencil!</p>
<p>One had a familiar character to its shaping
of letters!</p>
<p>A little way down the road, near the lake,
where the airplane had cracked up, Al drew his
machine in under a tree, almost tore the book
out of his pocket and opened it hastily.</p>
<p>On one page was a maxim, exactly what a
pilot might write:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing when to stay on the ground makes
a better pilot than knowing how to get off it!&rdquo;
It was signed with initials&mdash;&ldquo;T. J.&rdquo; Al did not
recognize the writing although, he understood
that the saying meant that a pilot wise enough
to be cautious was better than one who thought
that getting into the air was all there was to
flying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>The second page revealed one word, the
pilot&rsquo;s good-luck wish, and two initials also:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tailwinds! J. T.&rdquo; it told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T. J. and J. T.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly Al drew out the folded, ragged,
dirty little note&mdash;his clue.</p>
<p>It exactly corresponded in every character
with the short autograph!</p>
<p>But!&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Who had written the autograph? Had Mr.
Jones? If his name was Jones he would have
signed the initials on the first autograph&mdash;&ldquo;T.
J.&rdquo; Or&mdash;would he have signed that way?
Might he not have signed the reverse? Had he
written either page? Who else had helped?</p>
<p>More mystery! And no way to solve it!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>

<br /><span class="small">TANGLED THREADS</span></h2>
<p>On a former occasion Bob had related news
to an audience composed of Al and Curt.</p>
<p>As the trio rode homeward, Curt to share
supper with the brothers, Al was the spokesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see so many people to suspect
and so many clues that don&rsquo;t lead anywhere?&rdquo;
asked Curt when Al had told his story and had
shown his evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sky Squad has a mystery, and there&rsquo;s
no mistake about it,&rdquo; declared Al. &ldquo;We got
what we wanted, but now&mdash;what can we do with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Bob. I mean the autograph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it proves one thing, anyway,&rdquo; Bob asserted.
&ldquo;The single word matches our &lsquo;Everything
O.K.&rsquo; note. That proves that the man
who wrote the note is at that roadhouse, The
Windsock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; Curt agreed. &ldquo;But&mdash;is it the man
named Jones? Did he write it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did he write either one?&rdquo; Bob was puzzled
as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left the room, you said.&rdquo; Curt turned to
Al, who nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he didn&rsquo;t write anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does all that matter?&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;The
point is that we have proof that the man who
used the brown &lsquo;plane is staying at The Windsock.
Now our job is to discover who he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see those autographs again.&rdquo; Curt
drew his wheel to the roadside and took the
book from Al. &ldquo;&lsquo;T. J.&rsquo; is written with a plain
leadpencil,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;The &lsquo;J. T.&rsquo; one is
the one written in indelible pencil. &lsquo;J. T.&rsquo;&rdquo; he
repeated thoughtfully. &ldquo;Do you suppose Jones
transposed his initials and then got a waiter
or a clerk to write the other and sign what Al
would take for his initials?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too tangled up to suppose about,&rdquo;
argued Bob. &ldquo;Two things we do know from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is,&rdquo; Al remarked, as they resumed their
ride, &ldquo;one is that we know the brown airplane
man is at The Windsock. What&rsquo;s the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whether it&rsquo;s Jones or not&mdash;Jones has
something to hide, this proves. Otherwise he&rsquo;d
have scribbled a word or two for Al, and thought
no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;It simplifies things, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Al, speaking
after Curt&rsquo;s agreement, was not so sure as
his words indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes them more complicated,&rdquo; Bob retorted.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we know and where
we stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they rode slowly, he tabulated their clues
and theories and discoveries, with many interruptions
from his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;we saw a mysterious
brown airplane hidden in the woods. Then,
when we went there, it was gone&mdash;and this note
was flung aside. The crate took off in a hurry
because we saw heavy tracks, and made in a
hurry, by the way they looked. Then there was
a crack-up at Rocky Lake and we found out Mr.
Tredway was in the Silver Flash that crashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we saw a man come to try to help, swimming
across the lake,&rdquo; Curt broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we met Barney and he and Father
called us in to help solve the Mystery Crash,&rdquo;
added Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We learned there was more mystery than
just the fall of the crate,&rdquo; Bob went on. &ldquo;That
was bad enough; but there was more! Parts
were being stolen from the aircraft plant, and
&lsquo;planes had been tampered with&mdash;after tests
showed them to be perfect!&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;When we went there to work in the plant,&rdquo;
Curt was eager to add his contribution to the
sum of their recollections. &ldquo;We saw Mr. Parsons
acting suspiciously, and Griff, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have suspected Langley was in bad
company with Griff, and Lang got mad at us
about Griff&mdash;but we haven&rsquo;t found any reason
to suspect Lang, since,&rdquo; Al declared. &ldquo;But now
we&rsquo;ve got more people to suspect&mdash;the stranger
who came to the plant and this ex-pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this hasn&rsquo;t brought us any closer to
knowing anything definite,&rdquo; Bob objected. &ldquo;I
begin to wonder if Father was right, after all,
when he told us to &lsquo;drop those unimportant
things and locate that brown airplane.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; defended Al. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
way to start hunting. I&rsquo;m for keeping on disobeying
until something happens to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m for getting in to supper,&rdquo; Curt
changed the subject as they dismounted at the
cottage. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give what brains we have a
good rest while we eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one thing more and we will.&rdquo; Bob
paused, thoughtful and serious. &ldquo;Al said we
had no cause to suspect Lang. Well&mdash;today, I
was wondering why Griff was so nervous and
fidgety and furtive, and Lang came in and took
me out, to give me a lesson in handling the controls,
he hinted. He really did, but before he
took me up while he tested the new sport speedster,
he said, &lsquo;I see you&rsquo;re bothering Griff
again,&rsquo; and he gave me &lsquo;down the banks&rsquo; about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s suspicious about that?&rdquo; Curt asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that, so much. But&mdash;he told me to go
on home, that it was closing time, and I put on
my cap and punched the time-clock, and then
I recalled that I had left the baseball we were
playing &lsquo;catch&rsquo; with at noon, in my bench
drawer. I went back, and there was Griff, all
excited, and Lang, with his head close to Griff&rsquo;s,
acting as upset and as uneasy as Griff when
I came in and surprised them. Lang snapped
at me&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;like it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Curt was quiet, a little hesitant, but
firm. &ldquo;If Lang is mixed up in something wrong&mdash;we
ought to&mdash;at least we ought to try to save
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; agreed Bob, quickly. &ldquo;I
thought you were going to say &lsquo;we ought to
catch him with the rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I think more of Lang than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could we save him?&rdquo; asked Al.</p>
<p>To that they had no answer as they went in
to eat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>As they sat at the table Al mentioned the
morning&rsquo;s chat with Jimmy-junior, and suggested
that they really ought to go and spend
an evening with him as he had urged them to
do; if the others liked him, they could communicate
by nods and take him into the Sky
Squad, not as a full member, but just to please
him and have a fourth member to call on if an
emergency arose where he would be needed. Al
vouched for his innocence and good nature,
eagerness to please and willingness to work
without asking for explanations of why he did
a certain thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be a good one to send to watch anybody&mdash;Griff,
or the ex-pilot,&rdquo; Al spoke as the
trio rode toward Jimmy-junior&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob did not finish. He applied his coaster
brake, made a quick signal for silence, swerved
into a garage driveway, followed by his companions,
and dismounted, dropping his bicycle
on the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Al, thrilling to
some possible mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lang turned the corner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want him to see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; Bob answered Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where he&rsquo;s going.&rdquo; Curt slipped
along the side of the house by which they had
stopped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a terrible hurry,&rdquo; he reported,
coming back. &ldquo;In a second he&rsquo;ll be passing
this house. Get back&mdash;behind the house. I
don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll notice the bikes on the grass in
the dusk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>They hid from the view of anyone on the
sidewalk. Peering cautiously out in turn they
saw Langley hurrying by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;where&rsquo;s he going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall we do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See where he goes,&rdquo; Curt answered the other
two.</p>
<p>Lang turned the next corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s going to Griff&rsquo;s house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al was correct in his guess. As they trundled
their bicycles, keeping as far behind Lang as
they thought necessary, they saw him turn in at
Griff&rsquo;s gate. Five minutes later, from carefully
chosen points of concealment they saw Lang
come out, take Griff&rsquo;s repaired motorcycle and
ride off in haste.</p>
<p>Consulting one another with dismayed eyes,
the chums, by common consent, mounted and
pedaled for dear life along the street, around
the corner, back to the main highway.</p>
<p>They seemed to sense where Langley was going.</p>
<p>They did not, however, divine what he
planned to do!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">A PACKAGE OF MONEY</span></h2>
<p>Before they reached the aircraft plant toward
which they pedaled with all their power, Bob,
Curt and Al saw a light flare up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the flying field ready for a hop,&rdquo;
panted Al. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it could be Lang?&rdquo; Curt asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; Bob retorted, pedaling faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody at the gate,&rdquo; Curt called.
They were near enough to see the open gateway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The watchman&rsquo;s helping with chocks and
spinning the prop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, increasing his pedal revolutions, forging
ahead, spoke over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; called Curt. &ldquo;What are you going
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Bob slowed up his pedals, permitting the
bicycle to coast along as the modern, free-wheeling
automobile runs when the foot is removed
from the accelerator pedal. Curt caught
up to him. In a moment, as they approached
the gate, Al came up also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him see you at all,&rdquo; warned Curt.
&ldquo;Better wait and ask the watchman after he&rsquo;s
gone. You&rsquo;ll find out more, that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was good advice, and Bob agreed to act
on it.</p>
<p>They hid the bicycles, in case it turned out
that Lang had not left the ground. Careful not
to disclose themselves, they watched at the gate
as the engine of the sport model owned by Griff
was warmed up. In the flood of light on the runway
they recognized Lang as the pilot, and
watched him adjust flying helmet and leather
jacket, get into the craft, test the instruments,
checking carefully, and then get his wind direction
from the windsock, which told that the
light Summer breeze was from the South. The
watchman swung the tail around, set the chocks
again for a final test. Lang &ldquo;gave her the gun,&rdquo;
to see if everything was hitting perfectly, signaled
for the chocks to be removed, and since
his craft was correctly headed into the wind
the airplane taxied, gaining speed, and rose
swiftly into the dark.</p>
<p>Hardly waiting for the flood to be extinguished,
the trio of amateur detectives hailed
the watchman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too late to see Lang take off,&rdquo; greeted Bob.
&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say why he hopped at night did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he did! He&rsquo;s going off to see his uncle
about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; Al argued, under his breath,
to Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly is,&rdquo; Curt agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Bob spoke to the watchman. &ldquo;As
long as we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; he turned to his chums.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bring in our bikes and get some more of
those books on metal alloys Barney told us
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boss is here, himself,&rdquo; the watchman
explained. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barney was working late!</p>
<p>&ldquo;His office is lighted,&rdquo; Al commented. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
stop in and tell him about the note and the autograph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about Lang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must know Lang hopped off,&rdquo; Curt told
Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the crate made enough noise&mdash;unless
he&rsquo;s awfully busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barney was busy enough, but he had heard
the take-off, he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to check up on the firm&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;
Barney waved a hand toward the pile of heavy
volumes, ledgers, daybooks, indexes and others,
scattered on his desk. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find out what
way they&rsquo;re doing it, but something&rsquo;s being
&lsquo;worked&rsquo; about the materials.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;So Sandy told me this morning,&rdquo; Al stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t find it,&rdquo; he pushed three of the
smaller books into a large lower desk drawer,
and turned, mysteriously smiling. &ldquo;How do you
like this idea?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a few books
aside, and then, when the staff comes in, tomorrow,
I&rsquo;ll see how the bookkeeper and Parsons
take it. If there&rsquo;s anything &lsquo;flim-flammy&rsquo; about
them, they will show it when they miss the
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s dandy!&rdquo; agreed Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you figure on doing now?&rdquo; Barney
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;nothing special,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;We
thought if Lang was flying over to see Father,
that would take him about three hours&mdash;or four,
and he wouldn&rsquo;t get back here before morning,
so there&rsquo;s no use waiting for him to come
back here. But&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t anything special
to do, except go to call on Sandy&rsquo;s son, Jimmy-junior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not &lsquo;stick around&rsquo; here?&rdquo; suggested
Barney. &ldquo;For awhile, at least. I don&rsquo;t want
to be mixed up in anything, but if anybody
should come slinking around, I&rsquo;d like to know
it&mdash;as long as you have nothing much on hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s!&rdquo; urged Al.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; Curt agreed. Bob was willing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not put out all the lights, and just hang
around in the dark for an hour?&rdquo; suggested
Barney.</p>
<p>They agreed readily enough, and felt quite
like conspirators or real sleuths on a big case
as they occupied easy chairs in the big &ldquo;directors&rsquo;
room&rdquo; and talked in low tones.</p>
<p>Their vigil was soon rewarded.</p>
<p>Footsteps, sounding without effort at concealment,
in the corridor, caused all three comrades
to become tense and alert.</p>
<p>Bob felt a hand clutch his arm, and almost
called out in his nervous reaction until he
realized that Curt was whispering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al, already at his other side, was anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? Where?&rdquo; he said quickly but softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind the chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, hardly had they gotten into concealment
when they realized that there was no
need to hide; the steps went briskly past the
door and on, down the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; asked Al as a door opened and
slammed.</p>
<p>At the door to the hall Curt turned, waiting
until the other two joined him, he spoke quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wait here,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lightest&mdash;and
quickest, I think. Let me go on down
and &lsquo;snoop&rsquo; a little. He slammed the door so
hard it jumped open a little&mdash;it&rsquo;s Barney&rsquo;s
office!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney? He&mdash;do you suppose?&mdash;&rdquo; Al was
puzzled. &ldquo;He told us to wait, though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never Barney. I&rsquo;ll soon see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt was gone, tiptoeing, clinging close to the
inner wall, where, he felt sure, the boards were
so sturdy and well secured that they would be
unlikely to creak.</p>
<p>In suspense his companions waited.</p>
<p>Soon, in the dim hall, they saw Curt returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;Mr. Parsons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; Al was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunting for something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those books, I&rsquo;ll give you odds on it!&rdquo; Bob
spoke softly.</p>
<p>They waited, uncertain what to do&mdash;in fact,
there was nothing they could do but wait.</p>
<p>They had only a moment to decide. Down the
hall, from the stairway, came other steps; the
chums drew back inside the doorway. They let
Curt peer out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Griff, this time!&rdquo; he informed the others.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to meet his&mdash;no he isn&rsquo;t! Get
back! Hide!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Hesitating steps paused but before there was
any further movement Curt, Al and Bob were
well screened from any but a careful search in
full light.</p>
<p>They were glad, this time, they had gotten
under cover. Griff did not go to meet his father!</p>
<p>Instead he came into the directors&rsquo; room, at
least as far as inside its door, where, a faint
blotch against a very dull oblong of weak light,
Bob saw him standing, watchful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; thought Al, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t find out
about Mr. Parsons on account of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not hear anything; but evidently the
youth watching at the door did, for he came
further into the room. Would he decide to hide?
Might he choose the spot already occupied by
one of the youths?</p>
<p>Their suspense was relieved! He waited inside
the doorway, and it was a wait of a long,
dragging three or four minutes that seemed like
an age to the crouching trio; but finally he
walked out, his step confident and loud, showing
that need for concealment was over.</p>
<p>Quickly the three reached the door. Already,
as they peered out, a light was glowing, but not
electric ceiling domes&mdash;it was a pocket flash
held close to something in Mr. Parsons&rsquo; own
office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Like shadows the three, arms touching, went
down the hall. They could not contain their
suspense. At an open door, partly drawn shut
but not locked, they stopped. Looking through
the crack, hardly daring to breathe or move,
they saw Griff fit a key to his father&rsquo;s desk,
open it, take something from a small drawer&mdash;and
walk confidently, if slowly, to&mdash;the safe in
the corner!</p>
<p>Before it his light was held low, close. He
was manipulating the knobs of the combination.
As the partner&rsquo;s son he had access to it, the
chums realized. They forgot some of their caution
but not all; they peered closely in through
the crack of the door&mdash;and saw&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; breathed Al, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got&mdash;a package&mdash;of&mdash;money!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">CAUGHT AND CLEARED!</span></h2>
<p>Spellbound the three watching youths saw
Griff count the bills in that packet he had taken
from the aircraft plant safe.</p>
<p>They heard the ruffle of paper as he ran
through the ends of the crisp, new bills.</p>
<p>Then he stepped out of their line of vision.</p>
<p>With unexpected promptness, startling his
companions, Al flung the door inward so that
it banged against the wall. Instantly he leaped
into the room. His chums followed. Startled,
dropping his packet, Griff swung around to
stare in amazement and terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop those bills!&rdquo; Al cried needlessly,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve caught you red-handed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three of the Sky Squad were in the room.</p>
<p>Al dashed across to the window, to block any
possibility of Griff trying to drop the ten or
fifteen feet to the ground. Bob snatched up the
money. Curt blocked the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>After his first look of stunned horror, Griff
sank into the swivel chair and buried his face
in his hands. His shoulders shook with a sudden
revulsion of feeling that unmanned him,
made him sob like a creature in pain.</p>
<p>For a moment no one moved. The comrades
were rather dismayed and nonplussed by
Griff&rsquo;s pathetic attitude.</p>
<p>They had caught him, yes! Red-handed, as
Al had said, they had caught him, in the act
of something very dreadful.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his surprising way of giving in,
sitting there in a bent posture, with his body
racked by his sobs, made him a rather pitiful
figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; Bob said, finally, and rather
gruffly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done wrong. You&rsquo;ve been
caught. Take it like a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Griff replied in a shaking voice. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m
caught. I know I&rsquo;m a baby&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fought back his weakness and gulped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;what?&rdquo; demanded Curt. &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;ll say you were forced to do this by somebody
else. They always do, in books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Griff answered. &ldquo;No. I&mdash;it&rsquo;s all my
doing. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep saying &lsquo;but&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Al.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Griff had hard work not to break down
again. In spite of the way they had found him,
in spite of what he had been planning to do,
there was something that touched the youthful
hearts of the trio, in Griff&rsquo;s sorrowful eyes and
drawn face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;if only somebody could
help me instead of hounding me and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not &lsquo;hounding&rsquo; you,&rdquo; Bob defended
their action. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have done the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve been watching me and following
me and suspecting me,&rdquo; Griff declared sadly. &ldquo;I
know I deserve it&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Stop saying but!&rdquo; Curt was annoyed
by what he took to be an attempt to win sympathy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have helped you, instead of
&lsquo;hounding&rsquo; you if you&rsquo;d been honest, instead of
trying to be cunning and in with the wrong sort
of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you would!&rdquo; retorted Griff, bitterly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; declared Bob stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody helps me,&rdquo; responded Griff. &ldquo;Everybody
is after me for one reason or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re so furtive and fidgety
that you ask for it&mdash;and doing things&mdash;like
this&mdash;&rdquo; Bob shook the bills.</p>
<p>Griff sat in silence for a moment. Bob walked
over to the open safe, saw where the package
belonged, and pushed it into place, then
slammed the safe door, turned the knob of the
combination to lock it and swung back to Griff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That shows we&rsquo;re
helping you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; Griff stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean this!&rdquo; Bob came and stood in front
of him. &ldquo;I mean that the money is back in the
safe. If you can show any reason besides
temptation or somebody forcing you to do&mdash;this!&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
all promise to say nothing more
about the things we saw you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Griff shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; he said despondently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have that money. You
think it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; he could not bring out the word,
but he saw that the trio recognized what he
meant. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;because Lang is flying, right
now, to his uncle, to get him to come back and
give me money&mdash;a loan&mdash;to replace this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chums exchanged surprised, wondering
glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lang! Going to Father for money for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Griff answered Al. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s all
mixed up and&mdash;awful!&mdash;but you say you&rsquo;d help
instead of telling on me, if I could show I wasn&rsquo;t
as bad as you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob thought he saw a genuine honesty in the
clear look Griff gave him. His sympathy was
really quick and he wanted to be fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could count on that!&rdquo; he stated earnestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet you could!&rdquo; Al declared and Curt
added a similar assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought you meant that&mdash;if I thought
you&rsquo;d believe me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really we would!&rdquo; Al was also touched;
Griff, caught and breaking down and seeming
to be declaring innocence in some way, was not
the furtive, uneasy, shifty-eyed Griff they had
known. &ldquo;Honestly! Try us and see.&rdquo; He and
Curt moved closer. The three stood in a group
in front of the huddling youth in the swivel
chair.</p>
<p>Griff looked up dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will make me out bad enough,&rdquo; he stated.
&ldquo;But&mdash;not as bad as you&rsquo;ve been thinking. Oh,
I know!&rdquo; he took on a touch of his old defiance,
&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve tried to connect me with all the
wrong things that have been going on here! I
know I&rsquo;ve acted as though I am guilty. I&rsquo;m
not, though&mdash;not in the way you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Curt admitted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll listen.
We&rsquo;d rather have you innocent than guilty&mdash;of
anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if our case&mdash;&rdquo; Al stopped suddenly,
but Griff nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you all think you&rsquo;re clever,&rdquo; he said,
forgetting his own trouble for a second or two.
&ldquo;You come here to learn all about this mystery
of where the missing parts go and who did
things to the crates, and why. Don&rsquo;t you think
we have eyes? It&rsquo;s all over the plant what you
are trying to do. Don&rsquo;t you suppose we all
know one of you is a close friend of the other
two, and Bob and Al are sons of a detective?
What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer seems to be that you thought
we weren&rsquo;t smart and so you went right ahead.&rdquo;
Curt was a little nettled by Griff&rsquo;s statement,
although common sense told him, now that Griff
mentioned the point, that their scheme must be
fairly evident to any sensible person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think whether you were smart or
dumb,&rdquo; Griff replied. &ldquo;I had too much on my
mind. Bad as it is, it might as well be confessed.
I gamble, and owe money for it, and
I came here to borrow this from the safe&mdash;it&rsquo;s
as much my father&rsquo;s as anybody&rsquo;s, because he&rsquo;s
Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s partner, but&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t intend to
try to &lsquo;get away&rsquo; with the money. I only wanted
it overnight. Before the office opens Lang will
be back with the money to replace it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes it so important to get money
at this time of night?&rdquo; demanded Curt, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better tell the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re listening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead. Tell us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Griff nodded. Dejectedly, shamefaced and
humble, he related his story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running around with a pretty
rough crowd,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;and they got me
in the habit of going to places like The Windsock,
out on the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know!&rdquo; Al interrupted impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. There&rsquo;s ways to gamble, out there,
if you know the people who run the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;he owns it, yes. Mostly its Jenks,
his manager, and the waiters that let the crowd
do things outside the actual license rights of the
roadhouse. Well, anyhow, I got to spending
money pretty fast and I gambled. After awhile
I lost so much I found out I was owing the
&lsquo;house&rsquo; as they say, more than two hundred
dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although several maxims and Biblical quotations
sprang into Bob&rsquo;s mind, he kept silent.
This was no time for preaching, for pretending
the &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; pose. Under the same
temptations, argued Bob to himself, it would
be hard to say whether he&rsquo;d go Griff&rsquo;s way or
not. It isn&rsquo;t how good a fellow thinks he is,
but how good he proves himself to be under
temptation, that counts, Bob decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re taking the money for&mdash;or
trying to,&rdquo; Curt determined. &ldquo;But why did
you have to take it this way, and at this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manager at the roadhouse said, last
week, he&rsquo;d have to get all the debts owed the
house and clean up, because they&rsquo;re spending a
lot on a new dance place, like a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hangar. We know. Never mind why they
wanted it. Tell me,&rdquo; Bob changed the subject
for a moment, &ldquo;what does the owner look like?
Is he short, thick-set&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the manager&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that man let on to be Jones.&rdquo; Al broke
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he did? What were you doing there&mdash;snooping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Curt, pacifically, wishing
to get Griff&rsquo;s side of the matter first. &ldquo;We
wanted a specimen of his handwriting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish <i>I</i> could get one!&rdquo; declared Griff, ruefully.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the whole trouble, fellows.&rdquo; His
manner was more eager, more confidential. &ldquo;I
paid the money once&mdash;and he didn&rsquo;t give me a
receipt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Bob was connecting some things in his
mind. &ldquo;He came here one evening and demanded
the money, and you gave him a parcel
and then realized he didn&rsquo;t give you a receipt.
You tried to chase him on your motorcycle and
got into an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were watching, but I was too
excited and upset to care,&rdquo; agreed Griff. &ldquo;Yes,
I had borrowed from all the fellows I knew, and
had scraped every cent out of my savings account,
and I had the money. But he didn&rsquo;t give
any receipt, and when I finally got over the
smash of the motorcycle and went to ask for it
he declared I&rsquo;d paid him with a package of
wadded, folded paper and not money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was money,&rdquo; declared Bob. &ldquo;Unless
you changed it, because I caught you wrapping
up something green the day I came into the engine
assembling room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was money, all right enough,&rdquo; Griff asserted.
&ldquo;But he wanted it twice. Well, I had
promised my father that I wouldn&rsquo;t go with
that crowd any more, and I had been weak and
went against my promise. So I couldn&rsquo;t go to
him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had, and made a clean breast of it,
he would have gotten you out of this scrape.&rdquo;
Bob had to say that much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo; Griff was morose. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
got so much worry on his mind about the plant
and all that&rsquo;s happened that he&rsquo;s jumpy and
nervous and suspicious and he&rsquo;d throw me out
of here, and maybe send me away from home.
And I am trying to go straight. I will&mdash;I make
a vow on that!&mdash;if once I can get out of this
scrape. I&rsquo;ve learned a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that fellow at the roadhouse knows
you&rsquo;re afraid of your dad, I guess,&rdquo; asserted
Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and when I said I had paid the money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I overheard that,&rdquo; Al stated, and related
what he had heard through the open office window
at The Windsock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows have been on the job!&rdquo; There
was a note of admiration in Griff&rsquo;s voice, then
he sobered and went on. &ldquo;Yes, that fellow, out
there, knows about me being afraid of Father,
and he said if I didn&rsquo;t have the money tonight,
before midnight, he&rsquo;d tell my &lsquo;old man&rsquo; as he
calls Dad. They&rsquo;re opening a dance place and
he said the cash was essential tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you told Lang and he went to get it,&rdquo;
ended Curt for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s going to call me, long distance,
as soon as he gets there, and I was getting
the money out so I could start for The
Windsock the minute he calls up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your father doing out there so
much?&rdquo; demanded Al, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to &lsquo;get a line&rsquo; on me, I guess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt turned to his comrades with a rueful
grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;That explains everything,&rdquo; he stated, almost
regretfully. &ldquo;Griff has cleared himself, and
his father&rsquo;s motive is logical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It leaves us &lsquo;up in the air&rsquo;&mdash;and not in any
&lsquo;crate&rsquo; either!&rdquo; agreed Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Bob. &ldquo;Barney said the case
was all sewed up&mdash;but the threads must have
been weak, because here&rsquo;s our case all torn
apart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Curt, &ldquo;for my part&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Griff and Mr. Parsons were cleared of
suspicion, the other two agreed promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be cleared,&rdquo; said Griff sadly, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m not out of trouble. If I don&rsquo;t get this money
to that man&mdash;Jenks is what we all call him,
Toby Jenks!&mdash;why, he&rsquo;ll call up Dad&mdash;and
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We said we&rsquo;d help if you could clear yourself,&rdquo;
stated Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will!&rdquo; agreed Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all our heart!&rdquo; added Al. &ldquo;But&mdash;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take the money out there!&rdquo; urged
Griff. &ldquo;Just keep quiet about catching me
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if the money belonged to your father,
which the stockholders of the corporation might
argue out with you,&rdquo; said Bob seriously, &ldquo;taking
it, just overnight, would be&mdash;wrong, to say
the least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to Mr. Parsons&mdash;to your
father?&rdquo; suggested Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got all this worry on his mind, trying
to see what&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Al, &ldquo;I guess it would be
better not to worry him about this, if we could
see how to get around it and still not let you
take this money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suspected him,&rdquo; Curt said, rather
ashamed but anxious to be as frank as Griff,
whose manner and actions convinced them that
he had been absolutely honest with them. &ldquo;We
suspected him of being mixed up in something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody suspects everybody else,&rdquo; admitted
Griff. &ldquo;Dad suspects Barney, Barney
suspects me, I suspect the supply clerk and the
bookkeeper of working together to get cheaper
supplies here, and they suspect each other and
everybody else&mdash;even you three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bob waved the statement aside, &ldquo;that
isn&rsquo;t getting down to brass tacks. Think, for five
minutes, everybody. We&rsquo;ve got to help Griff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing their case destroyed, their chief suspect
cleared, they turned loyally to help to retrieve
themselves by aiding him.</p>
<p>For five minutes no one spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">THE &ldquo;MYSTERY CRATE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Father ordered us to drop this part of
things,&rdquo; said Al finally, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad we disobeyed
if it helps Griff to get out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; admitted Bob. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t
what we were quiet for, to talk about what
we&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know what to do!&rdquo; Curt commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was coming to,&rdquo; defended Al.
&ldquo;Let Griff stay here with you, Bob, while Curt
and I ride out to The Windsock. We can call
up as soon as we arrive, and then wait outside,
hiding. Then Griff can take this money
and come out, and pay it, and then we will jump
in from outside the door and grab it and jump
through the window and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the best you can do?&rdquo; scoffed Curt.
Al grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked good till I said it,&rdquo; he admitted,
&ldquo;then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you, all the way!&rdquo; his brother challenged.
&ldquo;Quick on the trigger and sorry when
the bullet hits the wrong target.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a plan, though,&rdquo; suggested Curt. &ldquo;Al
and I can go out to The Windsock, as Al said,
to get a good place under that office window.
Then, when Griff pays the money, we will be
witnesses, and if the man tries not to give a receipt
we&rsquo;ll be on Griff&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, but not perfect,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the head Sleuth of the Sky Squad
has the one perfect plan!&rdquo; Al was sarcastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bob was honest, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t! I thought
of having Griff call the man and say he&rsquo;d be
there bright and early with the money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did tell him that, when Lang left. He said
it would be tonight, whether he got it from me
or from my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-m-m!&rdquo; Curt was thoughtful. &ldquo;Bad!
Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could keep that Jenks man so busy,
keep his mind so much occupied he&rsquo;d be too
excited to think about Griff&mdash;&rdquo; Al was not very
sure of himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;We could!&rdquo; Curt astonished Al by accepting
the idea. &ldquo;Look here! If he isn&rsquo;t the ex-pilot,
maybe the ex-pilot wrote that other autograph.
Whether he did not or did, anyhow the
Jenks man had something to conceal, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to the trouble of giving Al
two specimens of writing to get mixed up with.
Now&mdash;if we were out there, and Griff tried once
more to stave off payment till morning, if he
agreed, all right, we could come home and this
money in the safe would be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Logical so far,&rdquo; agreed Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. If the man refused to wait, we
could telephone in to Griff to find out, and if
Jenks refused to wait, we&rsquo;d walk in on that
Jenks fellow and say we knew he was mixed up
in something wrong about the airplane crash,
and throw out hints, and so on. I think, myself,
he is in it somehow. He&rsquo;d bluster, maybe, but
if he has anything to conceal, we could scare
him, and then tell him to let Griff alone for the
present or tell his story to a policeman&mdash;and
we might hint that he could explain a lot about
the crash&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it as well as anything you&rsquo;ve suggested,&rdquo;
said Griff. &ldquo;If you could &lsquo;get way with
it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust us to scare him good and proper!&rdquo;
declared Al. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask him &lsquo;how about the brown
&lsquo;plane&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good,&rdquo; argued Bob. &ldquo;We looked that craft
up in the official registry and she&rsquo;s from out
West, and while we know her markings we
haven&rsquo;t found her and I don&rsquo;t believe he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Al defended his deduction. &ldquo;I think
he had it brought here for him to use, and then
taken away again, and that accounts for his
note&mdash;&lsquo;Everything O.K.&rsquo; when the pilot left it
there and he put the note on the seat to show
he had been there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe this Jenks hopped off, in the
morning, met the &lsquo;plane Mr. Tredway was flying,
forced it into trouble, rode it down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we saw the big cabin ship!&rdquo; objected
Bob to Curt&rsquo;s theory. &ldquo;There was no other
ship around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure!&rdquo; argued Al. &ldquo;That brown
crate might have been up above, against the
dark clouds in the sky! You couldn&rsquo;t tell if
we heard one or two engines. He could have
surprised Mr. Tredway, could have driven him
into a dive&mdash;something may have gone wrong&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Barney examined the craft when it was
hauled in,&rdquo; urged Bob. &ldquo;Nothing was wrong
with it at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Al was obstinate, &ldquo;I think what I
think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who owns the brown &lsquo;plane?&rdquo; asked Griff.
&ldquo;Did you look that up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we did! No name we know. No one
mixed up in the case. It was probably hired
by wire, or telephone, from somebody we don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t important, anyhow,&rdquo; Curt declared.
&ldquo;Not right now. What do you think of my idea,
Griff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for anything that will tide me over till
Lang gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; Al jumped away from
the group and was already at the door. Bob
hesitated a moment, then, seeing how eager Curt
was to echo Al&rsquo;s enthusiasm, he agreed.</p>
<p>After the two started for The Windsock, Bob
sat with Griff, giving him the facts they knew,
the theories they had formed for awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tangled up, and no mistake,&rdquo; Griff, recovered
somewhat, but no longer fidgety, feeling
that aid was being given him in his trouble,
rose. &ldquo;Look here, Bob&mdash;I was so excited, I
didn&rsquo;t eat any dinner. What say you stay here
in case a call comes in, while I run out and get
some coffee and sinkers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock the desk first! I don&rsquo;t want to be
caught here with it open.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right! I shan&rsquo;t need the slip that has the
combination on it, any more.&rdquo; He put a paper
in a small drawer, closed down the roll top, adjusted
his cap at a more confident, rakish angle,
and sauntered out, while Bob made himself comfortable
at the desk in the swivel chair.</p>
<p>The minutes dragged along.</p>
<p>In the deserted office building there was almost
no sound&mdash;a rat crept toward a wastebasket,
ran back as Bob moved in his chair; but
otherwise the place was very still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an airplane engine!&rdquo; Bob mused,
as, in the silence, he caught the faint, steady
drone coming from the sky.</p>
<p>It grew louder&mdash;rapidly, much louder!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be Lang, coming back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob went to the window. The sound seemed
to come from the other side of the building.
He ran across the hall into the directors&rsquo; room
and got to the window, which had a fire escape
stairway outside it.</p>
<p>Just as he peered through the bars of the fire
escape, he saw a craft swoop down, quite low.
It did not land! Instead, it seemed to zoom
along and to rise swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overshot the field,&rdquo; Bob mused. &ldquo;Why
doesn&rsquo;t he drop a Verey light to signal the
watchman to turn on the landing floods? Or&mdash;maybe
the watchman isn&rsquo;t out there. I&rsquo;d better
see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>He ran down the stairs and out into the yard,
across it and onto the small landing field. The
craft had passed, but he could still hear the
engine. It seemed from its change of location,
that the craft was coming around in a spiral.</p>
<p>Bob ran toward the switch controlling the
flood lights. One of the large, hooded lamps was
near it. As the sound of the engine came closer
he switched on the floods.</p>
<p>To his surprise the sudden light seemed to
startle the pilot&mdash;at least the craft seemed to
waver, to skid, to drop, and then, to catch its
flying speed and control. But it did not spiral
as he expected a pilot who had waited for light
would do.</p>
<p>Instead it began to climb.</p>
<p>Swiftly, eagerly curious, Bob caught hold of
the handle on the adjusting mechanism of the
flood light. It could be lifted, or set lower, to
govern the range and height of its beam.</p>
<p>Bob proposed to use it as a searchlight, to
illuminate the craft if he could swing the heavy
lamp upward in time.</p>
<p>Eagerly he labored with the mechanism.</p>
<p>Slowly the beam lifted.</p>
<p>Its intense rays caught the craft&rsquo;s underwings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; The watchman ran
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>For answer Bob pointed excitedly toward a
brown, sharply outlined craft, climbing, growing
dim in the fainter beam as it receded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s the mystery
crate&mdash;the brown airplane!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">BOB PURSUES!</span></h2>
<p>Realizing that the watchman did not know
what he meant by &ldquo;the mystery crate,&rdquo; Bob hurriedly
told of the earlier experiences: all the
while he talked his mind was busy, underneath,
wondering why the pilot of the brown ship had
flown over the plant, why he had appeared to
lose control when the light flared up, why he had
climbed to get away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; said the watchman. &ldquo;Anyhow,
that&rsquo;s clear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to see him get away!&rdquo; Bob said, sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whyn&rsquo;t you chase him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Bob was startled by the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;you! Didn&rsquo;t I see Lang giving you
lessons, and Griff, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but, at night&mdash;and Lang has the small
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman seemed to have caught the excitement
of a chase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, though!&rdquo; he cried, beckoning as
he ran. &ldquo;In the hangar is a crate just like Griff&rsquo;s
model&mdash;belonged to Mr. Tredway. He&mdash;he
won&rsquo;t need it no more. Whyn&rsquo;t you?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Once you get off the ground, the air&rsquo;s
all the same, day or night, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not exactly, Bob demurred, There were many
considerations to be thought out, but his father
had said &ldquo;locate the brown ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here it was, flying away!</p>
<p>It seemed to be &ldquo;up to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get the crate out? Can we get it
started? Is there any fuel aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the watchman had hold of the tail
assembly of a trim, slender, dark fuselage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab on!&rdquo; answered the watchman, jockeying
the fuselage so that a wingtip missed the
span of the cabin &lsquo;plane&rsquo;s spreading airfoils.
&ldquo;Grab on! I know you lads is detectiffs, and
here&rsquo;s your chance for a medal or somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob &ldquo;grabbed on!&rdquo; with spirit. He had caught
the enthusiasm of the older person. It took them
only a short time to jockey the craft into the
open, to get its gauges checked, to see that it
had oil and at least a tank of gas three-quarters
full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holler out!&rdquo; The watchman stood by the
&ldquo;prop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas on?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gas on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman spun the propeller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contact!&rdquo; he yelled, stepping swiftly beyond
the range of those deadly sharp blade tips.</p>
<p>There came the snap and bark of the motor.
Cold! But Bob, feeling that for all the precious
seconds it must waste, he ought to be safe before
he might be sorry, allowed it to warm up,
checked his instruments as he had observed
Lang and Griff do, and then, as the watchman,
obeying his signal, kicked away the chocks so
the wheels could move forward, the amateur
pilot, steady and cool all at once, glanced at the
windsock, saw that he could take off straight
down the short field, pulled open the throttle,
tipped the &ldquo;flippers&rdquo; so the tail ceased to drag,
as the propeller blast caught the elevators, and
began to race down the field.</p>
<p>As he went he tipped the elevators sharply,
felt the ship sway a trifle, realized he was off
the ground and moving steadily, climbing to the
roar of the engine!</p>
<p>He smiled a little. He had not forgotten to
hold the ship level for the brief seconds that it
needed to assume flying speed after the first hop
from earth. He had not climbed her at too
steep an angle, there was no indication, at least
to his inexperienced hand, of any logginess of
the controls presaging a stall. He was away!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he thought, with a sharp glance
around the sky spaces, &ldquo;I am in for it. If nothing
goes wrong with the machinery or the prop
I guess I can keep this crate level and get somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But where?</p>
<p>In those precious moments the brown ship
could have gone ten miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was mightily interested in the aircraft
plant,&rdquo; Bob reflected, letting the ship &ldquo;fly herself,&rdquo;
as most well balanced aircraft will do in
steady air, as long as flying speed is held. &ldquo;Now
all that we have found out, so far, has centered
about the aircraft plant and&mdash;and The Windsock!
Could he be around there? Or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a new thought struck him he gripped the
stick a tiny bit tighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Or, maybe he&rsquo;s brought the brown ship
back for some new stunt! It might be hidden in
that field again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed the stick a trifle to the side, thus
operating the ailerons, while he used his rudder
experimentally, meaning to swing in a circle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Whether a good Providence watches over
amateurs, in sports or in professions, or
whether Bob had actually learned from his lessons,
the fact is that he did not overbank or use
too much rudder, and neither felt the wind of a
skid on one cheek nor the breeze of a slip on
the other. Around went the ship, in a wide
swing.</p>
<p>Bob kept his eyes on the sky, with momentary
glances at the instruments, not all of which
were understandable to him yet; however, he
knew the altimeter, the tachometer which
records engine speed, the gas and oil pressure
gauges and such important ones.</p>
<p>They seemed all to record satisfactorily. His
altitude was six hundred feet; a little low for
safety, so he climbed to twice that. The revolutions
were even and plenty for his need, as he
watched the fluctuations of the tachometer when
he eased the throttle forward in his climb, or
backed it gently in the level-off.</p>
<p>Gas and oil recorded without a hitch or a
diminution of supply.</p>
<p>But where was his quarry?</p>
<p>Far ahead Bob saw a tiny flare of red in the
sky.</p>
<p>He nearly lost control in his excitement, but
with the true air-sense he caught the tendency
of the sideslip by opposite rudder and aileron
and then banked and circled till his nose pointed
straight for the dying flare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Someone in the sky was signaling for something!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get there soon! And see!&rdquo; Bob told
himself. He held the ship level, glancing at the
&ldquo;bubble&rdquo; in the spirit level, as he gave the gun,
opening the throttle steadily.</p>
<p>To the roar of the engine, the sing of cool
wind in taut wires, the sting of pulsing blood
pounding a thrill-song in his temples, Bob took
up his quest, and soon saw, ahead, the dim outline
of a circling ship. It was dark. Was it
brown?</p>
<p>He dared not get too close. Rather, he preferred
to climb, so as to be safely out of the
other fellow&rsquo;s way if he maneuvered.</p>
<p>From above Bob planned to light a white
flare, by whose light he could identify the ship.</p>
<p>But the other fellow saw him too!</p>
<p>Bob needed no flare to tell him that he had
discovered the brown craft&mdash;its action was indication
enough! The pilot dived, and then went
into a barrel-roll, dangerous at a low altitude,
Bob thought.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;stunt&rdquo; enabled the ship to get to one
side and out of his line of flight if he dived for it.</p>
<p>Clearly this showed that the unseen pilot
feared to be attacked, driven down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>But Bob had no such intention, he merely
followed as the small, brown craft, speedy and
capable, went fleetly through the night.</p>
<p>Bob, easing his throttle a little more open, as
he got the line of flight, held his elevation and
his level position; he did not try to overtake the
other, he wanted to see where he went&mdash;nothing
more!</p>
<p>So the flight held, one about five hundred feet
up, the other easily as high again. The speed
was almost identical, the ships were well
matched.</p>
<p>But the other man had some tricks up his
wings, in a way of speaking!</p>
<p>He began to climb. Bob, fearing to be over-reached,
climbed also. Higher, higher they both
went, Bob still atop the other, for he had as
much power, as well angled wings, as clever a
ship as his adversary.</p>
<p>But the battle of elevation was short. At fifteen
hundred feet the brown &lsquo;plane went into
a wingover, and to Bob&rsquo;s dismay it was, by that
maneuver, in a reverse direction to the flight
of his own, and he dared do no maneuvering,
no stunting, at night and alone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Before he could swing in the easy circle which
his inexperience compelled him to use, the other
pilot was almost out of sight. He climbed, and
thus Bob gained, but he saw that his pursuit
was futile.</p>
<p>The man was climbing into a cloud!</p>
<p>In its misty vastness, surrounding a ship like
a fog, an inexpert pilot could not know, without
continually watching his spirit level and
other instruments, if he flew level or on his
back, if he was going sidewise or straight toward
earth. To watch the instruments &ldquo;to fly
by the dashboard&rdquo; was useless; he could not see
to follow if he risked the feat.</p>
<p>Disgusted, disappointed, he cut the gun and
slowed his ship, and flew around toward The
Windsock. Somebody on the ground was burning
several land flares, he saw.</p>
<p>It told him one thing! The other fellow had
been expected! His signal had been seen.</p>
<p>For an instant Bob was tempted to try a
landing, to see if they would be startled, those
people down there in the glare. Did they perhaps
think he flew the craft they expected? It
would be worth something to discover that. Or&mdash;would
it? The danger, the risk, was considerable.
It was strange territory to him. The
people, seeing his craft markings, its different
color, might extinguish the flares, leaving him,
low, to &ldquo;set down hot&rdquo; or to climb, too late, and
land in trees!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>No, it was not worth the risk.</p>
<p>If his adversary had gotten away that was
the end of the adventure.</p>
<p>Only&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">SUSPENSE!</span></h2>
<p>When Al and Curt, riding easily, reached the
region of the Rocky Lake Park, they hid their
wheels in the well remembered field, preferring
to advance on foot, to spy out conditions before
arriving at the roadhouse to which they were
going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something going on, over there,&rdquo;
said Curt, as they walked, facing traffic, along
the familiar highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new dance floor&mdash;The Hangar&mdash;is opening
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will make it easy for us to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may not allow juniors on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t chase people away! It would
be bad for the business!&rdquo; chuckled Curt. &ldquo;Every
young man can have&mdash;must have&mdash;at least two
in his family, and they might be dancing papa
and mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go on and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The new dance floor, built in an old-looking,
metal-covered addition at the side of the main
hotel, was crowded. A &ldquo;jazzy&rdquo; orchestra, with
many toots of its saxophones, howls from clarinets,
trills and staccato yaps from its trumpet,
put rhythm into the march of many feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes me wish I had a girl and had her
here and knew how to dance,&rdquo; laughed Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I wish more is&mdash;&rdquo; Al did not get
time to express his desire to have Bob along,
to advise him in his rather impulsive acts. A
man in a dress suit, as the drums rolled in warning
to attract attention, advanced to the edge
of the band platform and addressed the dancers
applauding their last &ldquo;number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay&mdash;deeze&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;gemp&mdash;mum!&rdquo; Al
nudged Curt and whispered that the man was
Jenks. &ldquo;For this opening night the manage&mdash;munt
has went to the special expense&mdash;youse
mus&rsquo; excuse my poor way of speakin&rsquo;. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
only a simple flyer, an&rsquo; my eddication don&rsquo;t go
no higher&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al exclaimed, and Curt scowled at the aspersion
thus put on the intelligence of the
most manly, most steady, best educated general
class of men in industry&mdash;pilots!&mdash;but they listened,
nevertheless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;The manage&mdash;munt has put on a extra fine
show for tonight. In fact, folks,&rdquo; his manner
became more natural, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve engaged a stunt
flyer to come over here tonight, to fly around up
in the dark blue, and to do stunts, with rockets
and colored lights so you can see what he does.
I understand the whole crate is to be lit up
some way. So, if you&rsquo;ll all step outside, while
we put tables in here for refreshments, you will
have the free entertainment as soon as we can
get his signal and let him know to go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Curt and Al were already outside, they
craned their necks.</p>
<p>While the laughing couples gathered, a small,
red flare was visible. The men who seemed to
be awaiting this signal, lighted flares. But to
their amazement the ship did no stunts! It
went away!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny!&rdquo; muttered the excited, disgruntled
manager, Jenks, close by Al and Curt.</p>
<p>As the flares brightened it seemed as though
there were two airplanes dimly reflecting the
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they aren&rsquo;t doing any stunts!&rdquo; complained
a girl to her partner. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he counseled.
Waiting, however, did no good.</p>
<p>The dancers, murmuring, and the manager,
trying to apologize, saying it must not be the
right crate, went back to dance, shoving the refreshment
tables roughly aside.</p>
<p>Al and Curt, waiting, watching, wondering,
saw the men stick the stubs of their flares into
the ground and walk off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look! He&rsquo;s coming back!&rdquo; Al pointed to a
speck. They listened and heard the drone of
an engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s back again!&rdquo; shouted Al, and the
people came out again, standing with backs to
the glaring light, shaded eyes turned upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;he&rsquo;s flying low, though,&rdquo; commented
Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Curt caught Al&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in
trouble&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he?&mdash;yes, he is! Listen! His engine
has stopped&mdash;dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s gliding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t land here,&rdquo; said Curt. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too
low to spiral and shoot this little clearing&mdash;anyhow,
it isn&rsquo;t a place to land&mdash;not for night
landing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the same things are happening
that happened&mdash;when Mr. Tredway was&mdash;lost!&rdquo;
Al murmured. &ldquo;That time, we heard the engine,
and then the ship dived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one isn&rsquo;t diving&mdash;it&rsquo;s gliding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Curt&mdash;he&rsquo;s getting over Rocky Lake.
Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he does go&mdash;down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off they pelted toward the road.</p>
<p>An airplane had been cruising over the flares.
Its motor had stopped. That was sure.</p>
<p>And no one knew it better than Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>For he was the pilot whose engine stop had
left him with a &ldquo;dead stick.&rdquo; He must glide.
He had enough gliding angle, he supposed, to
take him back to that providential field&mdash;if he
could throw over a flare and make some sort of
a set-down!&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>It was dangerous&mdash;but it must be done.</p>
<p>For, in spite of its danger, knowing well what
might happen, Bob had shut off his own engine&mdash;deliberately!</p>
<p>He had to&mdash;to save his life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; gasped Curt, running. &ldquo;See that
glare? The &lsquo;plane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On fire!&rdquo; panted Al.</p>
<p>Appearances are deceiving. To Al and Curt,
on the ground, with darkness, distance and
trees to screen the truth from them, it seemed
as though the glare they saw beyond the grove
must spell a blazing airplane.</p>
<p>Instead, the light came from a landing flare,
dropped by Bob.</p>
<p>As he headed over The Windsock roadhouse,
and decided to give up, to return to the aircraft
field, he had all of his mind and attention
on his craft. Because of that he was able to
notice a mystifying, if tiny bluish light, intermittent
and flickering, close to the pipe that
conveyed fuel from the tank to the mixing carburetor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an electric spark!&rdquo; he decided. He
was right.</p>
<p>Somehow, either through one of those malicious
acts which had already been done to other
ships, or from a rubbing wire, some electrical
conducting wire had worn off its insulation and
was bare, and each time it rubbed or touched
metal it made a spark.</p>
<p>If there is one thing more dangerous than
another in the air it is the menace of an open
spark close to gasoline feed lines and carburetor
mixing chambers.</p>
<p>Knowing it well, unable to determine the
cause, but sure that the spark was electrical
and dangerous, Bob took the only safe course.
As Curt and Al had observed, his engine
stopped. He cut off the ignition.</p>
<p>The sparking light ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought Bob, &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t use my
motor. That means I must glide. At this
height, if I remember what Lang said, the angle
that will give me safe flying speed will about
take me to that little field we first saw the
brown &lsquo;plane hidden in. Can I make it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>He depressed the nose, watching, by his
sense of touch, how the stick and rudder bar
acted. As he moved through the air he elevated
the nose a trifle, to get as flat a gliding angle
as he dared; but his whole mind was concentrated
on that feeling, that sense of heaviness
in the reacting of the controls. When they began
to respond sluggishly he knew enough to
sense that he was losing flying speed, approaching
the danger point called stalling, in which
the ship gets out of control, drops or slips or
does some other uncontrollable maneuver.</p>
<p>Always, in time, he lowered the nose, picked
up the needful speed, and thus, by coming as
close to the &ldquo;graveyard&rdquo; glide, or flat angle,
as he dared, and yet conserving enough reserve
speed to keep the lift of the wings more sustaining
than the downward pull of gravity, he held
his craft in the air.</p>
<p>Always the nose, pointed into the wind, went
lower. Always, as he tried to penetrate the
darkness of the night and of the brown earth
below, his eyes, over the cockpit cowling,
searched for the flattish, light spot he wanted.
Along its inner side was the strip of turf he
needed.</p>
<p>Fear-thoughts flashed through his mind:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can I glide that far? Will I overshoot or
undershoot? Will I misjudge the height as I
come down, if I do make it? Will I set the ship
down too suddenly, so it will bounce off and
then&mdash;with too little margin of height to get
speed again&mdash;crack up? Will I stall too high
and smash down? Will I be going too fast, and
run too far? Can I glide in to the turf or will
I set down in stubble and nose over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resolutely, by all the will power he had, Bob
crushed out those nerve-deadening, muscle-binding
terrors.</p>
<p>There was the field. Where, now, did they
keep the light producing flares? Oh, yes! There,
in that little boxlike compartment.</p>
<p>He flung a detonating flare that would light
in the air or on striking earth. Its light was
what horrified Curt and Al.</p>
<p>To Bob, its glare was a great relief!</p>
<p>The white gleam showed, far ahead, faintly
lit, the field. His course would take him toward
it, but he altered the direction of his flight
slightly to get over the turf, then corrected the
bank, leveled his wings, depressed the nose still
more, picked up speed and, with all his force,
sent a landing flare into the air, as far ahead
and to the side as he could fling it.</p>
<p>Then he &ldquo;shot&rdquo; the field, got his nose directly
onto a line with the large trees at the end of the
field, pulled up the nose more, to kill all the forward
momentum he dared, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Bob gasped. He was too far to one side. He
would land in the stubble. Also, he was a little
too high.</p>
<p>Wildly he flung the flare he had been getting
ready.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Then, from some hidden source of remembered
instructions he got the instinctive knowledge
of what to do.</p>
<p>He dropped the left wingtip by pushing the
stick sidewise, and felt the ship tilt. It went
into a sideslip. That both lost speed forward
and got him further over to the left.</p>
<p>Opposite rudder, hard! Up left wingtip, down
right! Nose down a little! Speed enough to
go on!</p>
<p>With his heart in his mouth, looking swiftly
down, Bob saw the earth seem to come up at
him. Up elevators! Stall. He&rsquo;d have to take
it! He was close to earth, over turf. He must
not keep that nose down and glide into the trees
or taxi beyond the end of the turf.</p>
<p>The ship stalled, landed with quite a jar&mdash;but
the trucks held up!</p>
<p>And Bob, from his heart, breathed a little
prayer of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>He had done his best, had held his head, and&mdash;he
was safe!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">CROSSED WIRES</span></h2>
<p>By the time Curt and Al got their bicycles
and pedaled to the vicinity of Rocky Lake,
Bob&rsquo;s flare was out and they had no means of
ending their suspense until they had looked
around in the picnic grove and assured themselves
that there was no burning airplane in
sight.</p>
<p>They rode along the highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a flashlight, in the old field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like one, Al.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pedaled faster. Presently the pair
reached the field; soon Bob, using a small
pocket flashlamp, was telling his brother and
his best friend how the electric spark had worried
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew the brown airplane was gone,&rdquo; he
continued his explanation, &ldquo;the only thing left
for me to do was to head back to the plant.
But I saw that quick little flicker close to the
gas line and cut off the ignition switch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tracing the wiring,&rdquo; Bob told his brother.
&ldquo;And here is a wire! It ought not to be run
so close to the gas line! And here is another,
away back under the dash instrument board.
They cross!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crossed wires!&rdquo; gasped Curt. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; agreed Bob. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned
enough about airplane construction at the Tredway
plant to know they don&rsquo;t do such careless
things as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then somebody deliberately did it,&rdquo; concluded
Al. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of the scheme to damage
the crates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that!&rdquo; Bob climbed to the
ground and faced his companions. His face,
hard to see in the dark, because he was saving
his electric battery, was very serious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
worse than just tampering! Fellows&mdash;this is
Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s own airplane!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; commented Curt soberly. &ldquo;Some one
wanted harm to come to the owner of the
plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the &lsquo;some one&rsquo; made sure it would. In
daylight,&rdquo; Bob stated, &ldquo;that spark wouldn&rsquo;t
be noticed. It was only by being out in the
dark of night, that I could see it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;But crossed wires ought not to rub enough
to wear out the insulation in a short time,&rdquo; objected
Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither they did. Al&mdash;Curt&mdash;the insulation
was scraped away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent for a long moment. The full
wickedness of that deliberate act made each of
the youths feel rather cold. They were dealing
with something more sinister than an attempt
to make away with small airplane supplies,
to damage airplanes for the purpose of
injuring the reputation of the manufacturers,
as they had decided the conditions seemed to
indicate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Curt became practical, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t fly
that ship home, not in that condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had some adhesive tape,&rdquo; Bob said, &ldquo;I
could tape the wires and get back to the aircraft
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got bicycle friction tape in my little
toolcase.&rdquo; Al ran to get it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is hard to reach,&rdquo; Bob told Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I could do it,&rdquo; Curt responded. &ldquo;My
hands are thinner and my fingers are longer
than yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>As soon as Al brought the roll of pitched fabric,
Curt, with the flashlamp set for steady burning,
located the damaged insulation and began
to work with strips of the tape, having some
difficulty in winding it without pulling the wires
too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be a slow job,&rdquo; he called
out. &ldquo;Bob, somebody ought to go and call up
Griff, to see if he has any news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; Al agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you both go!&rdquo; Curt urged. &ldquo;One
could stay at The Windsock and watch and the
other could come back with news&mdash;or, Bob, you
could ride back on my wheel, to The Windsock
with Al, and then come on back here and we
two could fly back to the hangars together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you trust yourself with me, in the
dark, flying this ship?&rdquo; asked Bob. &ldquo;Something
else may be wrong with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. I&rsquo;ll look it over. I know how
they inspect them,&rdquo; Curt suggested.</p>
<p>Al and Bob agreed, and went to the two bicycles.
Off they rode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that &lsquo;plane again!&rdquo; Al pointed to
a tiny red flare high up over the roadhouse
ground. &ldquo;He has come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I frightened him away,&rdquo; Bob said.
&ldquo;He probably thinks whoever chased him has
given up, and he has come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing bothers me,&rdquo; Al observed, forgetting
his weary legs in the fresh excitement.
&ldquo;Why would a crate that has a pilot who flies
away from pursuit come back to do stunts?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
get there. See! He is looping, and he has
lighted some sort of rocket or bomb that makes
a trail of fire to show his stunt off in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob agreed with his brother&rsquo;s exclamation as
the airplane, high above them, with fireworks
leaving a comet&rsquo;s tail behind it, made a series
of loops, dived, zoomed, made a sort of &ldquo;S&rdquo; of
fire by side-slipping first one way and then the
other.</p>
<p>When they got back to the roadhouse the display
was over. Ground flares were going and
it was clear that the pilot meant to land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to see who it is, after all,&rdquo; declared
Bob, thrilled by the possible revelation
that was to come.</p>
<p>Curt saw the gyrating ship and its glowing
trail of sparks. He watched for a moment and
then went doggedly back to his work. If Bob
needed this sport craft, Curt proposed to have
it ready if careful, methodical work could get
it so.</p>
<p>Surprised, he heard himself addressed by a
youth who came over from the farmhouse whose
builder owned the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; asked the farmer&rsquo;s son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some display for the opening of the roadhouse
dance floor,&rdquo; Curt replied, tightening
down the tape and clipping off the end with his
pocket knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean yonder. I mean here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! A little trouble. Crossed wires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth did not understand; but he accepted
the explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you awful young to be a aviation
flyer?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;m not the pilot,&rdquo; Curt stated. He
explained. Then, his task finished, he clambered
down to see the glow of the distant, concealed
ground flares, and to guess that the sky rider
was going to land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is gettin&rsquo; to be a regular aviators&rsquo;
place,&rdquo; said the youth to Curt. &ldquo;Guess pa ought
to put up signs, &lsquo;Places to land for rent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do many crates land here?&rdquo; Curt was surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;look at them tracks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus having the spot indicated, even in the
dim light Curt was able to see that deep ruts
had been made, not only in the soft, ploughed
edge of the field, but also on the turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m!&rdquo; he had no explanation to comment.
It was unimportant. Something of
greater concern was on his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here, buddy,&rdquo; Curt said, &ldquo;will you help
me &lsquo;warm up&rsquo; this ship?&rdquo; He was searching
for two stones or blocks big enough to hold the
airplane still while the propeller revolved. &ldquo;The
pilot might want to take off now that I&rsquo;ve fixed
the damage.&rdquo; The boy agreed. Curt, locating
several rocks near where the brown &lsquo;plane had
once been hidden, set them under the wheels,
and then, realizing that the ship must take off
facing into the wind, he got the youth to help
him drag the tail around, to pull the whole ship
as far up at the end of the turf as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time I ever worked around a&mdash;er&mdash;&lsquo;grate&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Crate,&rsquo;&rdquo; Curt corrected, smiling in the
darkness. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a slang way of speaking of
an airplane, and it means either a term of fondness,
or of disgust, according to how the user
feels about his &lsquo;ship.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Gee! Wisht I could be one of them
aviator flyers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can, if you are willing to study enough,&rdquo;
Curt said. &ldquo;It means hard work. There&rsquo;s a
lot to learn. But a fellow who has ambition
can get to be anything he likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without being educated more than me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can pick up some education while
you&rsquo;re studying in &lsquo;ground school,&rsquo;&rdquo; Curt explained.
&ldquo;After you learn the parts of the airplane,
the way each one works, what it is for,
and so on, and how they are put together, you
have to study about airplane engines&mdash;the principle
of the internal combustion engine and
what all the parts are for and how they work.
There has to be study of&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;oh, yes!&mdash;aerodynamics&mdash;how
a ship flies, and why, and
what different air currents do, and how to know
their effects. There&rsquo;s navigation, too&mdash;the beginnings
of it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that? I thought you got in and pushed
something and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there weren&rsquo;t so many people who
thought that,&rdquo; Curt said soberly, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t
have so many accidents. Flying is a science;
and there&rsquo;s more to it than getting into the air
and going somewhere. It takes ground school
study to learn the foundation part, and instruction
flights to learn how things are handled, and
solo flights and stunting to show you how to
handle a crate in an emergency&mdash;and navigation
in its practical applications, for long flights. But
if you are in earnest, you can get all that, and
pick up practical arithmetic and grammar and
so on, in night school at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without money!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;unless&mdash;you might come over to the
Tredway aircraft plant and I&rsquo;d introduce you
to Barney&mdash;Mr. Horton, the manager. He
might give you a chance to work as a &lsquo;grease
monkey&rsquo; in the field, for he is awfully nice. He
helped all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth agreed eagerly, and then, with the
chocks set and the ignition switch off, Curt told
him how to work the propeller around, and got
him back to safety as the ignition switch followed
the gas &ldquo;on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engine took up its roar, and Curt knew
enough to shut down the throttle to idling speed,
allowing the slow revolutions to warm up the
power plant. He knew little about oil pressure
and instrument readings, but he knew that an
engine, to function safely and steadily, in flight,
must be warm.</p>
<p>While he busied himself getting everything
as nearly ready as his ability allowed, Bob and
Al reached the roadhouse.</p>
<p>The airplane had already &ldquo;set down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the brown one, and no mistake!&rdquo; Al was
thrilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Now, Al, the pilot must
have gone inside the roadhouse. I don&rsquo;t see
him around the dance place. You could go in
to ask for his autograph. I see you still carry
that little book. It ought to be easy to get a
look at him, have him pointed out to you. That&rsquo;s
really all we need.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Al agreed. He had no difficulty in getting a
busy waiter to jerk a thumb toward one of the
private compartments.</p>
<p>Al went to its door, pushed aside the curtains&mdash;and
stepped back.</p>
<p>What he saw stunned him!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">THE SKY SQUAD GOES INTO ACTION</span></h2>
<p>Three men faced one another in the small
compartment, made to look like a passenger
&lsquo;plane cabin.</p>
<p>As Al, at the curtained entrance, recognized
the one facing him, all three turned to look.</p>
<p>With a mumbled apology Al backed out.</p>
<p>More than anything else, he wanted to get
away, to see Bob!</p>
<p>The man who had faced him was Mr. Parsons,
partner in the aircraft plant.</p>
<p>The man to his right was the mysterious
stranger whom Al had seen in the supply room!</p>
<p>The third man&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Before Al could form his mental picture of a
face that seemed familiar, a bus-boy, with a
heavy tray of soiled dishes, bumped against
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out o&rsquo; the way,&rdquo; the youth grunted, to
Al, and gave him an angry push with his free
hand. Al, his balance disturbed, stumbled forward&mdash;into
the arms of Mr. Parsons at the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Struggling, squirming to get out of the powerful
grip on his arm and shoulder, Al found
himself held as if in a vise.</p>
<p>Suddenly his whole body went limp. His head
dropped, his eyes closed. He sagged down, and
surprised and disconcerted, imagining that the
youth he held might have fainted in his fright,
the man released him, lowered him to the floor
while he looked up, intending to call for aid.</p>
<p>Behind him another face looked out, the
bearded face of the man Al had seen previously
in the supply room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; cried Al, shrilly, as he tensed his
muscles, swung free of Mr. Parsons as the latter
bent over him. Like the leashed spring of a
panther Al&rsquo;s squirming, swift move took him
out of danger.</p>
<p>To cries, to shouts of surprise and of inquiry,
Al eluded the grasping hands of a waiter,
dodged a diner&rsquo;s gripping fingers, evaded the
move of a man to block him at the door, and
was free!</p>
<p>Quick thinking and a ruse had prevailed
where strength was not enough to accomplish
his wish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Speeding along, outside, after vaulting the
veranda railing, Al quickly located Bob. With
a wave of his hand Al signaled. His progress
was swift as he scampered across the parking
space, between standing automobiles, toward an
old barnlike structure backed into the grove.
Bob, seeing the wave and Al&rsquo;s progress, dodged,
on his own part, among the cars until he rejoined
Al in the open door of the old, dilapidated
barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al, pulling his brother back out of sight, recovered
his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bumped into Mr. Parsons&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and the man we saw in the supply
room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! What happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was somebody else with them. And&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t recognize him, because I was so surprised
and excited&mdash;but his face &lsquo;rang a bell&rsquo;
and I&rsquo;ll think who he was when I get quieted
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there comes Mr. Parsons! He&rsquo;s
looking for me,&rdquo; he ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has something in his hand&mdash;a package&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Al drew Bob further into the dark
interior. &ldquo;Bob&mdash;when I blundered in on them,
those men had&mdash;what do you suppose?&mdash;the
company books!&rdquo; Al clutched Bob&rsquo;s arm tighter.
&ldquo;You remember, we hid when Mr. Parsons was
in the offices&mdash;he took those books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bob&rsquo;s whisper agreed. &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s been
showing them to that man we saw, and to somebody
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parsons isn&rsquo;t as honest as Griff wanted
us to believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook Al&rsquo;s arm reassuringly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
admitted, &ldquo;I thought Griff&rsquo;s story was part of&mdash;what
did they say in the war?&mdash;oh, yes! It
was &lsquo;camouflage.&rsquo; Fancy paint to conceal something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only get the books away from
them&mdash;and tell Barney!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be coming to look for you. Mr.
Parsons must have recognized you, Al. I wonder
if there&rsquo;s a haymow over this old floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go along one wall and I&rsquo;ll take the other.
We&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried away from one another. Presently
Bob called out softly and, following the
wall, with one hand touching to hold his place,
the other extended ahead to avoid bumping into
any obstruction, the youngest of the Sky Squad
found his way to Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>There was a ladder against the wall. Bob
whispered instructions and started up the dark,
uncertain ladder. Bob had hardly reached the
top and called down a low reassurance when Al
almost scrambled in his eagerness to get up
quickly.</p>
<p>Voices were growing louder. Some one was
coming! It must be Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>At the top of the ladder, Al fell softly onto
the upper floor boards, and he, with his brother,
bent attentive, strained ears to catch the low
murmur from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s from the plant,&rdquo; a voice called, and
Bob recognized the quick, sharp tones of Mr.
Parsons. &ldquo;He was a boy from the plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got those books wrapped in record
time!&rdquo; someone else chuckled. Then, as the
youths drew their heads back, turtle fashion, to
avoid the glare, a match was struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody here&mdash;but yonder&rsquo;s a ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go up and have a look,&rdquo; said a third,
deeper voice. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to have those
kids snooping. I think Barney brought them
into the thing. They&rsquo;re only kids&mdash;but they have
eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, with a twist of his neck, looked around
in the dim upper room. Its end window, dirty
and cobwebby, allowed the moonlight to stream
in. The shaft of dull light streamed across,
slantwise. Bob, following its path with his eyes,
touched Al&rsquo;s arm. Gently he directed his
brother&rsquo;s gaze toward a corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Sacks, used for packing corn or other cereals,
were piled up there.</p>
<p>By common consent the two began a slow,
cautious movement toward the sacks; but Bob,
quick in an emergency, drew the whole pile,
very cautiously, partly lifting the lower ones,
to a darker place.</p>
<p>Al, close beside him, divined his idea. They
could hide under the large cluster of heavy burlap
bags.</p>
<p>By the time that a match was struck in the
upper floor they were lying, crouched, under a
number of the burlap bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here! Guess the kid was scared and
ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, though.&rdquo; Bob&rsquo;s breath almost stopped.
Had the other man who came up discovered
the sacking?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, though,&rdquo; the man repeated. &ldquo;We
meant to compare the books tonight; that&rsquo;s
why I took all the trouble with those stunts, to
have a logical excuse for landing here. We
can&rsquo;t, now! Those kids may have telephoned
somebody&mdash;whoever they&rsquo;re working for. Suppose
we hide the books, and get together tomorrow
night. I&rsquo;ll take the crate back and come
over by train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>In their stuffy concealment the brothers heard
steps, low muttered suggestions. Evidently a
place to sequester the company records was
selected. The youths quivered and Al nearly
screamed aloud as a sack was dragged from the
top of the pile. But the sack did not pull off the
ones they clung to over their perspiring heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff! On that shelf, and cover
&rsquo;em up. Nobody would think of that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Barney miss them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him worry a little. It will do him good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices receded. The heavy tread ceased.
Scuffling sounds told the brothers that the men
had descended the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; whispered Al, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re safe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we can take the books back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said &lsquo;on the shelf.&rsquo; Feel around, as
soon as they are out&mdash;wait! Al, I&rsquo;ll slip over
and spy out through the window&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al sat on the floor, among the sacks, mopping
his brow which was wet with hot perspiration
that had, a moment before, been ice cold. Bob
waved across the bar of moonlight. The trio
of seeming conspirators was safely away, he
indicated.</p>
<p>Again using their hands, they felt along the
walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>With his head, though jarred only slightly,
Bob found the shelf. A quick exploration defined
the books, in a compact roll of tape-tied
cloth, hidden under the sack. It was a second&rsquo;s
work to remove them and to rejoin Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;how can we get them away? Won&rsquo;t
they be watching?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alertly, and with caution, Bob protruded his
head over the edge of the opening by the ladder.
He was fortunate! In the doorway stood the
unrecognized member of the party, smoking.
Evidently he had returned.</p>
<p>Bob watched, holding Al in check by his grip
on the younger one&rsquo;s arm. The man did not
propose to leave, it appeared.</p>
<p>The sound of an airplane motor starting
conveyed the truth. He was waiting until his
ship was ready before going into the open.</p>
<p>Bob waited, Al at his side. Neither moved
more than was absolutely essential.</p>
<p>But Al, try as he would, could not suppress
the horrible inclination to sneeze, induced by the
dust in his nostrils from the dirty burlap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh&mdash;sh&mdash;huh&mdash;sh!&rdquo; he tried to hold back,
but Nature got the better of his will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh&mdash;shoosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;look&mdash;the window will
open. You could drop!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>The sound of the man ascending the ladder
came clearly.</p>
<p>Like two swift gazelles the youths dashed
across to the window, wide and old. It was
part of the door through which hay was drawn
up, they discovered. They tugged at it. On
rollers, but stiff from disuse, it stuck. Panting
they struggled. Closer came the ascending
steps, a call to know who was &ldquo;up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window slid open a foot&mdash;another foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to drop,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;You get back
and hide again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late! I&rsquo;ll drop the books to you! Go
on&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob hung by his hands, gave a swift glance
down, let go! No sooner did he land, with
loosened muscles to avoid the shock as much as
he could, than the package of heavy books
landed beside him.</p>
<p>Swiftly he grasped the package, and ran.</p>
<p>Al, almost caught, doubled with a swift, bending
squirm, as the angry man reached to
grapple with him in the moonlit doorway. By
his quickness Al was able to get away for an
instant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>He tried the same ruse he had used so well
before, but in another form. Every ounce of
weight he could put into it he gave to a run
away from the ladder. Then, doubling on himself,
but tiptoeing and bending as low as he
could, avoiding the moon ray, Al crept softly
along. The man, following the direction of the
footfalls, and thus trying to locate his quarry in
the dark, did not see the silent, gloom-hidden
form slip along the wall. Al was down the
ladder before his ruse was detected.</p>
<p>But the man ran to the doorway, shouting
through its opening.</p>
<p>Bob, racing toward the bicycles, realized that
the other two men, catching the warning shout,
were bearing down on him. Like a rabbit he
reversed his route, slipping in among the trees
behind the barn. But Mr. Parsons and the other
mysterious stranger were determined men. Bob
could not run and be silent. He dared not creep.
They were too close behind him.</p>
<p>Al, seeing that this pursuit was close, tried
to divert attention by shouting as he ran,
openly, across toward the bicycles.</p>
<p>But this did not draw the others away; they
felt that Bob had a parcel for which they meant
to catch him. On and on, through the grove,
dodging, squirming past trees, through briers,
Bob went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Curt, at the field, with the engine idling on
the airplane, did not hear the pursuit until Bob,
almost worn out, nearly done, came racing
along. Then, seeing him, Curt ran to meet him.
From the grove behind came the crash and
shout of pursuers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The books&mdash;hide!&mdash;&rdquo; Bob could say no more.</p>
<p>Curt caught the package as Bob hurled it.
Then, with an instinct that amounted to genius,
Bob noted a flattish stone, and as he ran he
bent, pausing an instant, and came up tugging
along the small, flattish boulder that, in the
dark could be mistaken for the package of
books. Unconcernedly, as though watching in
the role of a spectator, standing on the parcel
of books, Curt remained quiet, and the men
raced past him.</p>
<p>From the road, where he flung his bicycle,
knowing well where Bob would head for, Al arrived.
He raced toward the airplane just as
Bob ran in the same direction with his boulder.</p>
<p>Al, not unnerved by his excitement, realized
that if the propeller was turning, some chocks
or other means of holding back the ship were
in place. He bent under the wheels as Bob
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in!&rdquo; he cried. Bob, pretending to drop
the books in, let the boulder fall beside the turf.
While he was climbing in, the men paused for
an instant by Curt who said, sharply, &ldquo;There
he goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned, saw Bob was making for the
airplane, and ran toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Al tumbled into the rear cockpit, determined
not to be caught after the enmity he had
awakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me!&rdquo; he cried, but the roar of the engine
drowned his voice as Bob, risking everything,
in the dark, opened the throttle.</p>
<p>Up went the elevators enough to lift the tail
as the propeller stream swept against them.</p>
<p>Along the turf the ship began to move. The
men, aware of the sinister menace of the whirling
blades, fell aside. Bob, sensing the near
approach of the end of his runway, lifted the
elevators again, felt the ship going light, gave
her the gun, holding her just long enough on
the level after the take-off to get his speed&mdash;then
up he roared.</p>
<p>And a boulder beside the turf remained, while
Curt, with the books under his arm, among the
trees, went to Al&rsquo;s bicycle&mdash;and delivered the
books to his uncle&rsquo;s study.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t stay at home. Mr. Wright was
not there. Bob and Al would fly to the plant.
Thence, on tired feet, Curt pedaled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">DRIVEN DOWN</span></h2>
<p>Almost as soon as he lifted the airplane above
the grove beyond that cornfield, Bob recovered
his wind and his confidence.</p>
<p>Al, of a more nervous type, was still trembling
in his after-cockpit seat, but his excitement
was changing from that of the recent adventures
to the thrill of sky-riding at night with his
brother. There was not only the elation of the
climb to keep his nerves quivering; also there
was the uncertainty of what might happen because
of Bob&rsquo;s lack of skill and experience.</p>
<p>Climbing steadily until he was over five
hundred feet above the earth, Bob felt none of
his brother&rsquo;s uneasiness or excitement. He was
confident that he could control the airplane as
far as straight flying was concerned; his only
difficulty would be the landing, not the easiest
thing for a skilful pilot unless a signal could be
given that would make the plant watchman illuminate
the small field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Bob, making a long swing, banked gently, to
head back for the plant, calmly considered the
elements of the situation and tried to plan, as
well as he could, how to meet whatever came up.</p>
<p>Al, giving more attention to sky and earth,
as they straightened their course, correctly
pointed for the field at the plant, saw a tiny
set of glinting lights far away in the sky.</p>
<p>Impulsively he caught the stick of the dual
control to waggle it. That was the only way to
attract Bob&rsquo;s attention; but Al, in his quick
way, shook the stick and then held it pretty far
to one side, and Bob, not expecting the move
and unaware at first that Al did it, felt his heart
sink for an instant, fearing that something had
gone wrong with the controls.</p>
<p>Al, horrified at the effect of his move, sat,
tensely still, waiting for a crash. Bob, alert,
decided in a flash that he would do all he could
to avert the smash before he gave up hope. He
made the necessary moves to correct the slip.</p>
<p>To his delight the craft obeyed promptly, coming
back into its proper position quickly. Turning
to reassure Al, Bob saw his brother violently
gesturing toward the sky to one side. As
he looked Bob saw tiny lights and knew them
for the flying lights of a craft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>The explanation came at once. Al had attracted
his attention to the airplane knowing it
must be the brown &lsquo;plane. Probably the two
men who had chased Bob had contrived to tell
the pilot, before he took off, that&mdash;as they supposed&mdash;the
company books were in Bob&rsquo;s possession.
With a wave of his hand toward Al,
reassuring him, Bob set his course for the flying
place belonging to the Tredway plant. He
was being pursued by the ship he had, recently,
followed; it suited him. He would lead the ship
back there, contrive some way to attract attention,
get Al to drop flares, and then, landing,
telephone all the airports nearby to identify and
stop the pilot who must eventually alight for
fuel.</p>
<p>The pursuer, however had no intention of being
lured.</p>
<p>Bob realized it, at the same time that he recalled
how swiftly the other pilot had climbed
to escape identification earlier at the plant.</p>
<p>Instead, the brown ship had some sinister intent
toward himself, Bob guessed, for it was
climbing rapidly, and Bob, unaware of the safe
climbing angle or stalling angle of his own
craft, dared not risk so steep a tilt.</p>
<p>Higher, always higher above him, went the
other man&rsquo;s lights.</p>
<p>The wing over him obscured Bob&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>He turned to Al. The younger brother leaned
out and stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going up yet!&rdquo; he cried, and gestured.</p>
<p>Climbing! Climbing faster!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Bob opened his throttle steadily to the full
capacity of the engine.</p>
<p>He proposed to gain all he could in speed,
and that meant distance ahead of the other,
while that other airplane climbed. He knew he
could fly faster, on the level, than a climbing
ship could, and he saw the other lights slowly
becoming somewhat fainter, smaller.</p>
<p>But that did not last long.</p>
<p>In a few seconds the other ship leveled off
and began to approach. Bob, craning his neck
to get a sight of the other craft beyond his own
wing spread, saw that the other man, evidently
angling down and pointing directly for a position
above him, meant to overtake him and was
quite capable of doing it. He had superior experience
and skill.</p>
<p>Bob realized quickly that the better part of
valor in an airplane at night, under such conditions,
was to give up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, at least to pretend to give up,&rdquo; he reflected.</p>
<p>To carry out that pretence he reached into
the signal light stores and selected a light. This
he tossed back to Al.</p>
<p>His signal and his act were understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Al knew that Bob wanted light. He ignited
the flare, which proved to be a green signal
blaze, flung it overside and watched its tiny
parachute catch the air and suspend it.</p>
<p>In that light he swung his eyes to see what
Bob meant to do.</p>
<p>The other pilot, arresting his dive, also flew
along level, and watched, it appeared.</p>
<p>Bob, lighted by the glowing green flare,
pointed to himself and then pointed to earth.</p>
<p>The other ship, coming steadily closer, was
quite plain in the illuminated space. Its pilot
made a similar gesture, pointing first toward
the airplane Bob piloted, then downward.</p>
<p>Bob lowered the nose and began to spiral, as
though looking for a spot on which he might
safely &ldquo;set down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a wider swing the other pilot flew, observing
his act.</p>
<p>Swiftly Bob summed up the situation. Beneath
him, easily reached, was the wide ribbon
of the asphalt highway. By heading almost directly
into the wind he could &ldquo;shoot&rdquo; the road,
and by keeping his engine running at partial
speed he could make a &ldquo;power stall,&rdquo; letting
the craft settle very gradually instead of trying
to glide down, guess at the correct height and
then stall and drop. To do the latter in the comparative
darkness of the highway might result
in smashed landing gear or worse if he stalled
too high and dropped, or it might happen
that he would &ldquo;put her on hot,&rdquo; or at too great
speed and without stalling, come against the
ground. In one case out of ten that might enable
him to roll along, but if he struck the slightest
uneven bit of road, or a bulge of the tar at
the intersections of the asphalt road blocks, up
would bound the ship, perhaps to stall herself
and crash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>By using power he could keep flying speed
while gradually settling until his wheels contacted
the road. He could also rise more readily
if he discovered that he had gone too far to
either side of the narrow road&mdash;wide enough
in fact but narrow from the standpoint of its
use as a landing place.</p>
<p>He gave up the half-formed notion of trying
to outwit the pilot.</p>
<p>The man meant &ldquo;business&rdquo; and that might
spell trouble for an amateur. Better far would
it be to set down and see what came of it.</p>
<p>As he saw the roadway ribboned out straight
ahead, with no headlights observable in either
direction, Bob lifted the nose a trifle, adjusted
the throttle until, with the road streaming backward
under him, he saw it very gradually growing
wider and clearer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Almost perfectly he landed. Being a straight
road he had lots of time to taxi, with his gun
cut and his only care being to hold the ship on
its wheels and not let a wing-tip scrape the
asphalt.</p>
<p>To his surprise the other pilot did not land.</p>
<p>Instead he seemed to be circling at a very low
altitude, not a hundred feet up, and with only
bare flying speed, diving ten feet to catch up his
speed and then climbing back to circle again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave this crate standing on the
highway,&rdquo; Al called as soon as Bob had the engine
running at idling speed. &ldquo;Suppose a Sunday
driver comes along at sixty miles an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo; Bob swung in his
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. If we go up he&rsquo;ll ride us down,
and we might not make as good a landing&mdash;you
might not, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder comes a car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Bob pointed, Al leaned out and stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The headlights blind me,&rdquo; he declared, shading
his eyes with his cap brim and hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s the ones who are after us,&rdquo; called
Bob. &ldquo;See! One of them is stopping the car
and the other one is jumping out.&rdquo; He turned
to Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think we have the books. The man in
the brown ship drove us down. Mr. Parsons,
in his car, with the other man, is coming to get
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Al, scrambling
out of the airplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! You run into the woods to the right of
the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al, as soon as he was on the ground, used his
heels to good purpose. Bob, pausing only to
bundle up some folds of his coat to make it look,
from a distance, as though he carried a package
under it, slipped to the road and ran the other
way.</p>
<p>Driven down, they nevertheless left the pursuers
outwitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">CURT&rsquo;S DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Those books are off my mind,&rdquo; Curt reflected
as he pedaled slowly toward the aircraft
plant, &ldquo;but my legs aren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d go to bed and
rest for a week if it wasn&rsquo;t for seeing what
Griff is up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had ridden only a block or two away from
his uncle&rsquo;s residence, where he had deposited
the books, when a thought occurred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how to get a &lsquo;tow&rsquo; to the plant,&rdquo;
Curt whispered to himself, swinging his handlebars
to turn into the next cross street. &ldquo;They
usually get shipments of fabric on the eleven
o&rsquo;clock freight, and our truck is there to load
it in.&rdquo; He glanced at his wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;it ought to be loaded
or nearly so&mdash;and that means the truck will be
starting soon. I&rsquo;ll ride along till it catches up
with me and then let it pull me where I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>It was a reasonable notion and well-founded.
That it was sound was soon proved, for Curt
saw the truck turning into the street just ahead,
from the direction of the station.</p>
<p>He had expected it to come from the street
he had passed, but realized that it must have
followed the direction it had been pointed instead
of turning around in the station yards;
increasing his speed for the moment, Curt
caught up with the tail boards of the large
truck, took hold with one hand, set his coaster
brake, and rode in comfort, resting his weary
feet.</p>
<p>To his great surprise the truck turned off at
a crossroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; he wondered.</p>
<p>He let go and dropped back a few yards, intending
to let the truck go; but it bothered him
to decide what caused the change of route.</p>
<p>Curt resuming his pedaling, following at a
little distance, determined that for all his weariness
he ought to find out why a truck, openly
laden with cases and parcels, boxes and canvas
sacks, should not go directly to its destination
to be ready for unloading when the plant
opened in the morning.</p>
<p>The ride was not more than a half mile.</p>
<p>Curt, keeping at good distance, let the truck
get around a bend. He could follow by the sound
of the motor. He did not wish to be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>There was in him the thrill of the discoverer
of a new clue.</p>
<p>When the motor ceased to send its roar across
the distance to him Curt laid Al&rsquo;s bicycle, which
he had ridden from the cornfield, beside the
rutted country road and walked, screening himself
carefully, to the bend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No truck should stop in this out-of-the-way
place,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better be careful. They
might have a guard set at the turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no guard, however. Evidently the
truck driver and his assistant had no suspicion
that they were observed.</p>
<p>Openly the truck stood in the road, to one
side. Curt, able to distinguish its bulk, was too
far away to see through the darkness what was
going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe a broken drive chain,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;d better be certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a slight detour through the pines
along the byroad, being careful to make as little
sound as possible, working around toward the
position of the truck. Whatever sound he made
was soon drowned by the roar of a motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a repair,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of getting further away the motor
pulsation became louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another car coming,&rdquo; Curt told himself,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a heavy duty motor, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>He made fast progress toward the edge of the
trees. There, hidden behind a large trunk of
pine, he could see the dim road, the dull outline
of the truck, and the moving forms of men lifting
things out and piling them by the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re unloading the truck!&rdquo; Curt was
amazed. Was this some bold banditry, some
open theft?</p>
<p>To his further astonishment and mystification
the other truck came along and stopped.
There was an exchange of low, but jovial banter
between the rough drivers and their helpers, but
no allusion was made to their task. Instead,
the men on the truck just arrived began also
to unload bolts, cases, boxes, sacks, from their
vehicle.</p>
<p>Curt could not figure the problem to a satisfactory
decision. Were they substituting one
load for the other? Why?</p>
<p>At any rate, they would be occupied for several
hours, Curt thought. He made his way
quietly back into the wood and hurried toward
his bicycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride to the plant, get the watchman to
telephone for the police, and round up those
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every ounce of his reserve energy Curt put
into his pedals as he bumped along the byroad
and then raced down the main highway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>When he came within sight of the aircraft
plant he was surprised at the activity displayed.
The flood lights were on. Far up overhead he
heard the sound of an airplane engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Curt was reassured. &ldquo;It must be Bob
and Al coming in. They will be glad to hear
I put the books away safely, and then we can
all ride back to the truck&mdash;no, we can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He
recalled that his own wheel was parked at The
Windsock&mdash;if no one had taken it.</p>
<p>There was no one in the watchman&rsquo;s place
by the main gate, which was open. Curt decided
that the man was at the flying field to
give assistance to the airplane as it landed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Al, turning at the door of the administration
offices, hailed Curt. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt raced across the yard, joined Al and
Bob at the office building doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;I thought you
flew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapidly Bob explained. &ldquo;We hoofed it back,&rdquo;
Al added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who is landing&mdash;or shooting the field
to land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be Mr. Parsons bringing in the ship
we deserted on the road. Did you leave that
parcel of books at Dad&rsquo;s? Good! But why did
you come back here, Curt?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>A quick explanation set everything clearly
before his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to go and round up the two
trucks,&rdquo; he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;we must get to Griff. He must be wild,
waiting without any word. I know the trucks
won&rsquo;t wait forever, but you can identify them
in the morning. Come on.&rdquo; Curt followed Bob&rsquo;s
lead, with Al at his heels as they entered the
office corridor.</p>
<p>Griff&rsquo;s voice came to them as they reached
the upper landing. He was talking&mdash;telephoning!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Langley! You got there! Good! What?
Your uncle is gone? Gone? Gone! Lang&mdash;where?
You don&rsquo;t know? What&rsquo;ll I do, Lang?
You don&rsquo;t know? Well, I do!&rdquo; and he slammed
the receiver on its hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; urged Bob as the trio raced to the
lighted doorway.</p>
<p>At the safe, kneeling, was Griff. He twirled
the dial, clanged back the safe door, reached for
the packet of bills again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t! You daren&rsquo;t. That
isn&rsquo;t yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>White-faced, Griff identified Al as the latter
called his warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must!&rdquo; he snapped, and stood up, holding
the packet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Over the offices came the drone of the approaching
airplane circling for a landing. Al
moved toward Griff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back!&rdquo; Griff was furious. Bob, behind
him, snatched the packet of bills, flung it into
the safe, slammed the door. Griff, with a furious
snarl, bent to recover the packet, but the door
was shut.</p>
<p>He flung off Bob, who backed into Al and
Curt.</p>
<p>Heedless of the roar of the airplane engine
as the ship came low over the office roofs in its
descent, Bob, Al and Curt disentangled themselves,
got to their feet.</p>
<p>Already Griff was by the safe, the combination
figures on the slip in his hand, the dial of
the safe door twirling and clicking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;what are you doing, Griff?&rdquo; Bob
cried out in dismay.</p>
<p>With a quick glance Griff measured them. His
face was white, his jaw was set, his whole attitude
was that of a terrified, trembling young
man who had determined on a course he knew
to be wrong but which circumstances would not
allow him to avoid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You daren&rsquo;t!&rdquo; corrected Al. &ldquo;Your father
has stolen the books, but you shan&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>The safe door was wrenched open. Bob
started forward, Curt at his side, to catch
Griff&rsquo;s hand, to prevent this thing he felt he
had to do. His fear of his father&rsquo;s anger was
greater than his dread of the boys, it seemed.</p>
<p>His hand on the packet of bills, Bob tried to
stop him. Griff, with a scowl and a wicked
word, kicked Bob&rsquo;s shin, avoided Curt&rsquo;s grasp,
and stood back, his face working.</p>
<p>There was an interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Al, nearest the door, called the
word. They were halted, frozen into statues
with tense poses and straining ears.</p>
<p>A step sounded in the hall.</p>
<p>Instantly, white with terror, Griff flung the
bills toward the open safe, kicked the door shut,
turned like a hunted animal and ran out through
an intervening door into the next office, and,
with Bob in hot pursuit, raced across the hall,
into the directors&rsquo; room, to its window and
down the fire escape. And Bob, at the window,
felt a hand grip his collar. He was caught!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">A CONFESSION</span></h2>
<p>Without a struggle Bob gave up. In the
dark he did not know who his captor might be;
but he reasoned that if it turned out to be
Barney resistance would be less sensible than
explanation. To struggle for escape if the hand
on his collar belonged to Mr. Parsons, would be
foolish and might make it harder for his chum
and his brother to explain their situation.</p>
<p>In his mind&rsquo;s eye Bob recalled how the office
had looked as he left it. Griff had kicked at the
safe door, believing the money had gone in;
but it had not! It had dropped on the floor.</p>
<p>Unquestionably Mr. Parsons, or Barney, or
whoever held him, had come past that office but
had not stopped there, preferring to make a
capture of the only person he could put his
hands on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Bob realized that non-resistance was a wise
course. As he had surmised, he was led back
toward the office. He was glad that he had done
nothing, said nothing to explain the situation
so far. The man who had hold of him, who
urged him along the corridor, was Griff&rsquo;s
father, the man from whom they sought to save
Griff.</p>
<p>At the office door Bob, panting and choked a
trifle by the tight grip on his coat, took in the
situation swiftly.</p>
<p>It looked, from all the appearances, as
though Al were dictating from the slip while
Curt manipulated the combination, to open the
safe; on the other hand, from another point of
view, it might appear that the pair had recently
had the safe open and were closing it.</p>
<p>What made that more probable to an outsider&rsquo;s
eyes was the package of greenbacks
which Al held!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; Mr. Parsons, half
dragging Bob along, made a quick, nervous advance,
caught the package from Al with his free
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that your&mdash;&rdquo; Al began in his imprudent
haste; Bob gave him a sharp, meaning
look. Al, catching it, realizing that he had almost
mentioned Griff, whom they had previously
agreed to aid, was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that we came back here&mdash;&rdquo; Curt
began and was interrupted by the angry partner
of Mr. Tredway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not content with taking those books,&rdquo; he
said angrily, &ldquo;you want to take the company
money&mdash;how did you get into my desk? Pick
the lock? That adds another count against you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He released Bob&rsquo;s coat collar and strode to
the desk, a flat-topped one in the center of the
room. Catching up the telephone receiver, he
made a call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello&mdash;hello! Give me Police Headquarters!
Yes, thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant the members of the Sky Squad
were stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mr. Parsons spoke into the
transmitter again. &ldquo;He is out? How soon will
he be back? Have him call Mr. Parsons, at the
aircraft plant! Yes&mdash;perhaps I can give him
some tenants for the new cells in the police
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the earpiece.</p>
<p>Bob, recovering his usual good judgment, began
to consider the very difficult situation that
faced the Sky Squad.</p>
<p>Al, however, seldom thought before he spoke;
more often than his brother, he was sorry for
hasty decisions and sharp speeches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry if you tell the Chief of
Police,&rdquo; blustered Al.</p>
<p>Curt, as thoughtful as Bob, trod on the foot
of the younger captive and Al, jumping away,
refused to be warned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If he thinks two
sons of a detective, and their friend will be put
in cells for trying to save&mdash;oh, all right, Bob!&mdash;for
trying to put money back into a safe&mdash;&rdquo; he
whirled on Mr. Parsons at the sound of the
latter&rsquo;s sarcastic laugh, &ldquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we were
doing! If the Police Chief arrests us&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
ask him to arrest you, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For taking the company books away. For
showing them to somebody outside the firm&mdash;planning
how to get more cheap parts into the
plant. Oh, we know all about you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I had company books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the pages open on the table at The
Windsock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Young man,&rdquo; he swung to Curt.
&ldquo;Please go into the bookkeeper&rsquo;s room, unlock
his book cabinet, and bring all the books you
find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt, surprised, took the small key from their
captor, went in and lighted the adjoining office,
returning, finally, with an armful of books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the books of a complete set
when you see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob does,&rdquo; declared Al, still angry, but becoming
a little uneasy. He might have jumped
to his decision about the books he had seen. He
was always making snap decisions!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examine that set, young man&mdash;er, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complete!&rdquo; Bob admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why were you in such a sweat to get
the others when we tried to&mdash;&rdquo; Al&rsquo;s voice tailed
down to nothing; he began to see how really
guilty they could be made to seem. There was
entry into the offices at night, an open private
desk, a tell-tale safe combination memorandum
on the floor, a package of bills beside the safe,
for one chain of evidence; there was an intrusion
on a private conference, at The Windsock,
and the subsequent escape with the books for
a second, not to think of Bob&rsquo;s use of the airplane
with no permission from a higher authority
than a watchman, and the infraction of
State law by landing on a highway and deserting
the ship in a traffic lane. Al&rsquo;s bravado began
to evaporate.</p>
<p>Bob, who had remained cool, thinking, was
able to see a brighter side to the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Parsons,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t call
in the police. That would force us to defend
ourselves. We could explain what we were doing
and why. But we have a&mdash;a code of honor,
and we would rather have you let things work
out without the police&mdash;and reporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would really suffer more than we
would,&rdquo; Curt declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so? We shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>The telephone bell blared. Mr. Parsons
turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he spoke into the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! Don&rsquo;t! Those fellows are protecting
me! I can&rsquo;t let them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Griff stood in the office door, his face white,
his lips quivering.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons, catching sight of his son, stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Griff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hello&mdash;is
the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! You shan&rsquo;t! You mustn&rsquo;t! Listen
to me. I took that money!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone receiver dropped, hanging by
its cord to swing unheeded against the man&rsquo;s
leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll confess!&rdquo; Griff, for all his fear of his
father, of consequences, was showing his true
manliness. &ldquo;I ran away, Father, because I
thought I had put the money back and locked
the safe. I didn&rsquo;t want to be caught. I thought
I could go down the fire escape and get away.
But when I saw you catch Bob I came back and
listened&mdash;I must not let these fine friends stand
a night in a cell for something I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, haltingly, ashamed and despairing, but
honestly, Griff cleared the Sky Squad and told
the truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was trying to get out of his trouble,&rdquo; Curt
said to end the deep silence that followed Griff&rsquo;s
explanation, &ldquo;and he didn&rsquo;t want to come to you
when you had so many things on your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cousin has gone to get money for him
from Father,&rdquo; added Bob. &ldquo;But Father must
have started for home before Lang got there,
and it was only when the man at The Windsock
threatened to come and tell you and make it
look worse than it is, that Griff lost his common
sense. We came back here to meet each other
and saw what he was doing and convinced him
it was a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impulsiveness of Al prompted him to
&ldquo;put in his oar,&rdquo; but his earlier bluster was
gone and he kept still.</p>
<p>They watched Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>His face was set and pale, his fingers worked
nervously. He had his head bent.</p>
<p>Bob, quietly picking up the telephone as he
heard the impatient voice of someone at the
other end of the connection making it squeak,
spoke into the transmitter quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call you back. Something has come
up to make things different.&rdquo; He hung up the
earpiece.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Apparently Mr. Parsons did not notice him
at all. Added to the blow given by his son&rsquo;s
confession that he had broken promises and
gotten into deep trouble was the knowledge that
three loyal companions, with full knowledge of
his guilt had not only protected him from himself
but had shielded him at the expense of being,
themselves, suspected and unfairly accused.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons looked up. He held out a hand
to Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am sorry!&rdquo;
Bob, smiling with some relief, eagerly gripped
the extended hand, to be followed by Curt and
Al.</p>
<p>Then the father turned to his son.</p>
<p>Three members of the Sky Squad held their
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; the voice seemed cool and sharp, but
it changed suddenly, &ldquo;Son, I guess I&rsquo;d have
done better to make a comrade of you than to
try to rule you with fear and threats. Come
here, Griffith.&rdquo; The young man advanced, hopeful,
but also shame-faced. &ldquo;Son, we all make
mistakes. If we learn not to make them again,
that is life&rsquo;s lesson. I am not a judge. I am&mdash;your
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Griff&rsquo;s hand reached out impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to tell you&mdash;but I guess if it hadn&rsquo;t
been to save these friends, I might have gone
on. I guess I&rsquo;m a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; cried Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you!&rdquo; Bob was equally emphatic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;It took more bravery to walk in under the
circumstances than to tell your father any other
time, I say!&rdquo; Curt exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will settle with that fellow at the roadhouse,&rdquo;
Mr. Parsons stated, when forgiveness
was assured to Griff and the five occupants of
the office were determined to &ldquo;work together&rdquo;
for a change, &ldquo;If he has been paid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not meet the Police Chief somewhere
and have Griff tell him the things that are done
against the law at The Windsock,&rdquo; suggested
Al. &ldquo;Then we could all go there and give evidence
of how Jenks tried to collect twice from
Griff&mdash;and maybe we would find out something
about&mdash;our own mystery. I think he is in it,
some way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons decided that he owed the Chief
some explanation of his call and, somewhat
over-excited, and not his usual sensible self, he
failed to realize just what Al&rsquo;s suggestion implied&mdash;that
they make Griff incriminate himself,
since he had played at the tables without
informing against the hotel. The Police Chief
agreed to meet them near the roadhouse, and
when Mr. Parsons hung up and turned back to
them he was much more calm than they had
ever seen him. &ldquo;If I explain my own purposes,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;it will be easier for us all to understand
and get together. I have been trying to
protect my absent partner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;Absent?&rdquo; Bob repeated the word, &ldquo;your absent
partner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Arthur Tredway. He went into hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; cried Al, &ldquo;I know now! I thought
the face of the man in that brown airplane&mdash;the
one who flew it&mdash;was familiar. That&rsquo;s Mr.
Tredway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy, you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Curt was rather stunned, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tredway&mdash;alive?&rdquo; cried Griff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, alive. This has been a very mixed affair,&rdquo;
the partner declared. &ldquo;I knew that Arthur
Tredway was alive, but I could not speak of it
or explain, because we did not know whom we
could trust, and so told no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;in the crash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons turned to answer Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he do it? Why did he hide and
let everybody think he had &lsquo;gone West?&rsquo;&rdquo; Bob
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember&mdash;crossed wires?&rdquo; Curt
reminded him.</p>
<p>That had to be explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;So someone crossed wires that were scraped
nearly bare, in Arthur&rsquo;s own ship!&rdquo; Mr. Parsons
was dismayed. &ldquo;That proves his suspicion
that somebody meant harm to him. And that is
what we hid him away to discover. If the accidents
ceased with his disappearance, he was in
danger; if not, the damage was aimed at the
aircraft company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t found out why he was in
danger&mdash;or from whom?&rdquo; declared Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted the partner. Al, fired with enthusiasm,
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons was not so sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">BARNEY GIVES A HINT</span></h2>
<p>While the quintet waited for the taxicab
which Mr. Parsons summoned from town, Griff
put the money back in the safe, thankful for his
escape. Bob, Curt and Al expressed their elation
that he was freed from suspicion, and Barney
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The watchman called me,&rdquo; the manager explained.
&ldquo;Things got a bit too exciting out
here and he thought I ought to know. What is
there to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explanations took up the time of waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m.&rdquo; Barney was pleased but thoughtful.
&ldquo;Glad to learn my best friend&rsquo;s partner is
cleared,&rdquo; he nodded at Mr. Parsons. &ldquo;Certainly
I&rsquo;m delighted that his son is all straight. And
Tredway is alive! Glory be! I&rsquo;m gladdest
about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would be,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Parsons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man who gave me everything I have,
made me the manager of his plant! I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m
glad he&rsquo;s all right. Well, let&rsquo;s go see that ex-pilot
and his wicked two-autograph ally!&rdquo; he
grinned at Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to try to catch those truckmen
first,&rdquo; suggested Curt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let them alone,&rdquo; argued Barney, and Mr.
Parsons agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what they were doing,&rdquo; he told
Curt. &ldquo;All you have to do now is check the
stuff that is unloaded from our truck in the
morning. If that turns out to be poor material,
trace the other truck, get your proof&mdash;and at
least one part of the mystery will be easily
solved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went out and packed into the taxicab,
giving its driver direction for meeting the
Police Chief at the edge of the picnic grove.</p>
<p>When they got there and related their experiences
they were daunted to find him decidedly
lukewarm about &ldquo;rounding up&rdquo; the ex-pilot
and his roadhouse manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the idea is so good,&rdquo; the Chief
of Police stated. &ldquo;Griffith Parsons has no receipt.
He can&rsquo;t actually prove that he paid real
money, or that he paid at all. Anyway, now
that his father knows the whole business, that
fellow, Jenks, hasn&rsquo;t a chance to collect again.
He won&rsquo;t dare try. Just what do you want me
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this note put on the airplane, and
his trying to avoid showing his handwriting by
giving me two autographs,&rdquo; Al suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way I&rsquo;m sorry to destroy that clue,&rdquo;
said Mr. Parsons, &ldquo;but when we get to the roadhouse
you will see that it has no value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you want me to do?&rdquo; repeated the
police official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought of facing the manager, Jenks,
with Griff&rsquo;s evidence of how he permits gambling
to go on&mdash;and other things outside the law&mdash;and
making him tell us what he knows,&rdquo; Bob
urged.</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking,&rdquo; the officer
chuckled as he eyed Bob, Curt and Al. &ldquo;Graft&mdash;hush-money!
But that isn&rsquo;t it at all. As far
as Griff&rsquo;s information goes, we&rsquo;ll take care of
that better by making a raid when the place is
crowded and the barn is actually in use for
illicit purposes. But, don&rsquo;t you see what you
are doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chums shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Barney, and Mr. Parsons agreed
again. &ldquo;If we offer to make him tell with a
threat of what we will do if he refuses,&mdash;we are
&lsquo;compounding a felony&rsquo; if we get him to tell
anything and don&rsquo;t go through with the legal
steps on the face of our evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Barney saw how disappointed the
three chums were, although they admitted the
justice of the official&rsquo;s attitude, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go out
and see my old patron and comrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief of Police agreed to look into the
charges Griff had made and turned his car to
return to his home, while Barney, in one cab
with Bob and Al, and Mr. Parsons in the one
they had called, with Curt and his own son, went
on.</p>
<p>There was a vociferous greeting between Mr.
Tredway and his plant manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you were all right?&rdquo;
he cried, pumping the plant owner&rsquo;s hand, slapping
his back, and, as Al said later, &ldquo;almost
kissing him,&rdquo; while the mysterious stranger,
and the others watched with various feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to make my plans in secret,&rdquo; Mr. Tredway
retorted. &ldquo;Not even my partner knew until
tonight. But&mdash;let us get acquainted, all the
way &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the mystery man behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my brother,&rdquo; he presented the man,
&ldquo;and so these are the three young men who have
worked so hard to solve the mystery of my
crash into the lake!&rdquo; He shook hands and they
selected a private dining room on the second
floor for a midnight repast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, smiling pleasantly at the
three rather silent youths as the first course,
a hot, nourishing soup, was served, &ldquo;have you
solved the puzzle of the mystery crash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have&mdash;but not all, sir,&rdquo; replied
Bob. &ldquo;I think I can put together what happened,
but not why it had to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Mr. Tredway encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; urged Barney. &ldquo;I admit I&rsquo;m
stumped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; Bob, without trying to be vain,
spoke frankly. &ldquo;We got mixed up and puzzled,
at first, because we were trying to solve a lot
of things by connecting them with your&mdash;disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we made the mistake of suspecting
everybody,&rdquo; interrupted Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mixed Griff&rsquo;s case in, and his father&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
agreed Curt, and he turned back to give Bob
the center of the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know whether the damage to
airplanes was aimed at the plant or at you direct,&rdquo;
Bob told Mr. Tredway, who nodded. &ldquo;You
had two airplanes&mdash;both alike, except one was
the Golden Dart and the other was the Silver
Flash.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And I thought,&rdquo; Mr. Tredway interrupted,
&ldquo;if the guilty person knew which airplane
I meant to deliver, he would damage that
one and so, at the last minute I changed my
ship, after saying I was going to deliver the
Golden Dart I took off in the Silver Flash&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were right,&rdquo; gasped Al. &ldquo;When we
flew the Golden one her rudder cable was frayed
and broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, my young friend. And nothing was
wrong with the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did you crash it&mdash;why did it crack
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tredway looked to Bob for an explanation,
desiring to test the youth&rsquo;s skill at deduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much to work on,&rdquo; Bob said modestly,
&ldquo;but this is how I think you did it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother flew here in the brown ship
and hid it in the field, leaving the note to show
you it was ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took off early, and then set down the
big cabin ship on the turf&mdash;that accounts for the
deep ruts&mdash;and the ship was in the way so you
dragged it into the stubble until the brown ship
got up, then took the cabin craft into the
air&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fail to see what the brown airplane, and
Arthur&rsquo;s brother, have to do with it,&rdquo; Barney
broke in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s brother had to be there to
bring down the cabin &lsquo;plane,&rdquo; Bob explained.
&ldquo;At least that&rsquo;s the only way I can see for the
tracks in the field, and the crack-up, to fit the
conditions,&rdquo; he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;they exchanged ships? Arthur
landed the cabin crate and then flew away in
the brown one, while his brother crashed the
Silver Flash?&rdquo; Barney demanded. Tredway
nodded as did his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young man is correct in his deduction,&rdquo;
the latter said. &ldquo;I had to come and exchange
ships with my brother and then crack up the
Silver Flash to give the idea that its pilot&mdash;and
my brother had taken off in it!&mdash;had gone
into a mudhole or under rocks in the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you expect to gain by that?&rdquo; asked
Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Removing one partner,&rdquo; Mr. Tredway
smiled, &ldquo;gave the other one &lsquo;a free hand&rsquo; if he
was in any way guilty, or you, Barney!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barney turned red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not suspect you, I only wanted to
get away and see what happened, and who did
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These young men have cleared most of us,&rdquo;
stated Mr. Parsons. &ldquo;They have done more!
They know how the good parts are taken and
cheap ones are substituted.&rdquo; He explained
about the trucks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t solve the mystery of why you
brought books here and then said the company
books were all at the plant,&rdquo; argued Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a small set of duplicate books&mdash;that
is, what we would call &lsquo;fake&rsquo; books&mdash;private
books in the cabinet,&rdquo; began Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>Barney bent forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find those? I had them in
my own desk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I took them from. You see,
Barney, as long as we all suspected each other
it was wisest for me to check them. Not that I
accuse you, because they were in your desk.
You were checking up, also, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not finished either,&rdquo; declared Barney.
&ldquo;But&mdash;as long as Arthur wanted a look at them,
it&rsquo;s all right with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have them safe,&rdquo; said Curt. &ldquo;And the
brother is the mysterious man with the dark
beard whose motorcycle Griff used, and it was
he who was in the supply room, the other
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s brother. &ldquo;I
came, with his key, got in the private gate, went
up the fire escape and down to check up in the
supply room&mdash;until Griff, running off with my
motorcycle, made me suspicious, scared and
anxious. So I left.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I came here to see Arthur&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo;
said Mr. Parsons, and Griff, looking ashamed
added, &ldquo;&mdash;and I ran away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know who damaged the crates,
or if it was against Mr. Tredway or just spite
work against the company,&rdquo; Al said. &ldquo;The
mystery crash has failed to bring that to light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Barney suddenly leaned forward,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go, out and dismiss my taxicab&mdash;it&rsquo;s
eating its head off&mdash;but first I&rsquo;ll give you
a hint to chew over while I&rsquo;m away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; several spoke the question in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose the motive was revenge,&rdquo; Barney
spoke very low, and Bob, watching some curtains,
at a locked side door, thought the breeze
must be stirring them, &ldquo;suppose there was once
a pilot at the plant and that Arthur had to fire
him and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say!&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Tredway
bent close, excited. &ldquo;The pilot I once discharged?
Why&mdash;he&rsquo;s the owner of this place.
I&rsquo;d never dream&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same&mdash;chew it over!&rdquo; Barney rose.
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be flying back&mdash;you won&rsquo;t
stay here tonight.&rdquo; Tredway shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be right back,&rdquo; Barney said. Bob, as the
others chatted softly and excitedly, followed the
departing manager with his eyes. He had
thrown suspicion on several, had Barney. Also,
he had been the only one who inspected and
then reported on the Silver Flash, that nothing
had been found tampered with! And&mdash;he had
chased Lang and Bob to see Bob&rsquo;s detective
father! What a lot of curious facts, Bob mused!</p>
<p>And when Barney rejoined them a moment
later Bob was still musing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be a good idea for all of us
to stay,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Parsons. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s after
midnight, and these lads must be worn out, with
all their pedaling to and fro. We can telephone
their homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may all stay,&rdquo; said Mr. Tredway. &ldquo;But
until we prove something I shall keep out of
sight. Especially if the ex-pilot is apt to be
around. I&rsquo;m going to warm up my brother&rsquo;s
airplane and hop back to the airport I came
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all parted. Curt declared he wanted to
secure his forgotten bicycle, Bob and Al were
sure they had better go on home if Mr. Parsons
would let them take the taxicab. He decided
that, after all, he and his son had better go
home. The meal was finished. Mr. Tredway,
going by a side hall, and down back stairs,
sought to avoid recognition while his brother
agreed to watch the ex-pilot at every chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>Bob and Curt found the bicycle safe, and
trundled it to the luggage rack at the back of
the taxicab.</p>
<p>Then Bob turned suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want to say something
to Mr. Tredway&mdash;he&rsquo;s warming up the
airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;recalled something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he reached the man so mysteriously lost
and so suddenly discovered Bob caught his arm
and spoke very earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the sake of your safety,&rdquo; Bob whispered,
&ldquo;take off, just as you planned&mdash;but only
go to the cornfield&mdash;set down as soon as you can&mdash;and
then&mdash;look for&mdash;crossed wires!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash he was beyond questioning!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;ONE MORE PROBLEM&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Bob did not delay a moment after he delivered
his solemn warning to Mr. Tredway.</p>
<p>As quickly as he could he located the plant
manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stay here
tonight! Come home with us. Stay with the
Sky Squad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of Sam Hill&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forgot where you were, didn&rsquo;t you,
when you spoke about the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he lowered his
voice, glanced around, spoke carefully, &ldquo;&mdash;the
ex-pilot as the one who had a motive for injuring
Mr. Tredway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I guess I was thinking pretty much
of what I was saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;did you hear anything or&mdash;see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I heard something. You didn&rsquo;t
think, but there&rsquo;s a curtained door in that private
room we used. How do you know Jenks or&mdash;the
other one&mdash;might not have heard you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lad, you&rsquo;re quick! Right, too. Maybe I&rsquo;d
better go on. But I won&rsquo;t need to stay with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d better. We can take turns watching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks! It&rsquo;s not as dangerous for me
as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least come back in the taxi with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right. I&rsquo;ll do that. But I&rsquo;ll go on
home, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come on, please&mdash;right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barney, half-amused at Bob&rsquo;s concern, and
partly wondering what caused it and if he actually
had been spied on, overheard, and realizing
even better than did Bob, he thought, how dangerous
such an accusation might be, Barney
agreed.</p>
<p>The ride back to town was taken up with discussion
of Barney&rsquo;s hint but through all the
talk Bob was rather quiet.</p>
<p>It was decided that the three members of the
Sky Squad would be taken home first, then Griff
and his father would go on, leaving Barney to
finish the ride to his own home.</p>
<p>As the car drew up in front of Bob&rsquo;s house
and Al began saying his goodnight, quite sleepily,
Bob turned to Mr. Parsons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to going back to the plant,
after you drop Griff, and getting the real set
of company books, and bringing them here. We
can work on them together, and see if there is
anything in the private set that doesn&rsquo;t agree
with the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not wait until morning?&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Parsons. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you worn out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What books?&rdquo; Barney asked. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;that&rsquo;s
so. I remember. You said you had them. Put
them away carefully! Don&rsquo;t leave them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we will,&rdquo; agreed Al, overhearing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
put them in the big desk in Father&rsquo;s study and
lock them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, goodnight,&rdquo; said Curt. He had been
invited to stay but he preferred to go on home.
Bob threw in a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Curt, why don&rsquo;t you let
me telephone your mother, and you stay. And
Barney could wait with us till Mr. Parsons
comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come to think of it, why not?&rdquo; Barney
decided. &ldquo;If it won&rsquo;t wake up your folks.&rdquo; Bob
assured him it wouldn&rsquo;t. His mother must still
be waiting up, he declared; there was a light
burning in his father&rsquo;s study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I never thought&mdash;supposing
Dad has come home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he has,&rdquo; Al agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see&mdash;will you come in with us?&rdquo;
he addressed Barney, and the latter cordially
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better let you wait in the living
room till we see whether it&rsquo;s Dad or Mother.
She might not be dressed for company&mdash;if
Mother is sitting up.&rdquo; Barney agreed to wait,
and Al went to the door to call Curt in to telephone
home.</p>
<p>The den, into which Bob turned, closing the
door quietly, was occupied, as he had all along
suspected it would be, by his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that you weren&rsquo;t in the other city,&rdquo;
Bob said, after a hasty greeting. His father
saw his eagerness and let him talk. &ldquo;Lang flew
there to get help&mdash;&rdquo; he sketched very swiftly the
incidents of the night. &ldquo;Now, Father, what
brought you home? Have you?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have suspicions&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been working on the mystery?&rdquo;
Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All along. I pretended to be busy on another
case because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suspected somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the start. Yes. Did you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not until tonight. But I know it&rsquo;s the same
person, and I&rsquo;ve got him in the living room and
I want to pretend to him that we are guarding
him from some one else, while we keep
guard to see that he doesn&rsquo;t take fright and
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father framed a name and Bob nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your proof?&rdquo; demanded his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to a detective at the very first. He
has put suspicion on everybody else. He seems
terribly anxious about those books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstantial evidence justifying suspicion,
but not proof. However&mdash;I&rsquo;ve learned
that some people, probably using assumed
names&mdash;it may all be the same person&mdash;have
been changing aircraft stock into gold. What
is your plan, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must keep him from guessing that we
suspect&mdash;and keep him where we can watch him.
The way I plan, if you agree, is this. Father,
if he is the guilty one, he is terribly dangerous.
He must have crossed wires on Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s
airplane, before the owner left the plant&mdash;hoping
he&rsquo;d have a short-circuit, set the gas on
fire and come down in flames. Then he thought
the Golden Dart was the cabin ship to be flown
and he frayed the rudder cable. When he discovered
the other ship was going he might have
crossed wires on that&mdash;remember, he mentioned
&lsquo;crossed wires&rsquo; back in the other city? And he&rsquo;s
the only one who inspected the Silver Flash
when she crashed and was hauled in. So we
must keep him here where we can hold him if
he makes a move.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Get him in, son. We will pretend to
study the books, and I will watch his reaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he doesn&rsquo;t betray himself?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will let him go. He cannot leave tonight
because if he has been taking stock and exchanging
it for gold, he probably had to bank
it&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t leave it in his house, would he,
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have detectives watch his house all
night. Father, fix it with the Chief of Police
while I get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barney was ushered in, Al and Curt joined
them and the three of the Sky Squad lined up
on the davenport to watch Barney as the detective
discussed the case.</p>
<p>But Barney did not betray any uneasiness.
He was clever, Bob decided.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons, for whom Al watched to let him
in without awakening Mrs. Wright, brought
other books and they were all busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve discovered something!&rdquo; Al exclaimed,
after half an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sky Squad will now report!&rdquo; chuckled Barney.
He turned to Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Chief Pilot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, very serious, nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Was Barney getting fidgety? Or, was he
simply eager?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo; his father prompted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve solved one mystery&mdash;how the bad
parts are coming in,&rdquo; said Bob, confidently.
&ldquo;Curt, bring the false ledger and the real one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All heads bent interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice how those tiny pencil &lsquo;ticks&rsquo; are
made in the beginning of some entries?&rdquo; Bob
pointed to several. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any in the
regular ledger, but the entries correspond, and
they are always worded in a queer way. See
this one, about fabric: &lsquo;10 bolts fabric, cotton,
quality A&mdash;dash&mdash;X&mdash;one hundred,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
quoted. &ldquo;Now all the entries that are ticked in
the false ledger are backward like that&mdash;and
the same in the regular book, but no others except
the ticked ones are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s curious,&rdquo; muttered Barney. &ldquo;What
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are several bills of lading that
weren&rsquo;t entered Saturday, just slipped into the
back of the regular ledger,&rdquo; Bob drew them out
and unfolded them. &ldquo;One is all right, but the
other is made out backward&mdash;the same as the
ticked ones&mdash;and it isn&rsquo;t a real bill of lading at
all, because it is dated for today, and the shipment
that arrived today isn&rsquo;t to be delivered
until tomorrow and we saw the two trucks exchanging
goods on the byroad&mdash;or, Curt did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very clever, but what does it prove?&rdquo; asked
Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bill of lading being dated ahead and
being one of the &lsquo;backward wording&rsquo; sort,
shows that those are the entries that are &lsquo;queer.&rsquo;
That solves the mystery, because we know how
those things are being substituted tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who does it incriminate?&rdquo; asked Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;whoever&rsquo;s writing matches this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the bookkeeper is due for a call on the
carpet&mdash;maybe worse,&rdquo; said Barney. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
his book, and the false set is the same handwriting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles that mystery and leaves only
the one about Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s possible evil
wisher,&rdquo; said Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s attended to&mdash;all we need to do
is to watch that ex-pilot, and Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s
brother has agreed&mdash;&rdquo; Al paused. The den
private extension telephone was ringing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you, Bob,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d
be&mdash;oh, Mr. Tredway! How are you? Glad
you&rsquo;re &lsquo;alive and kicking.&rsquo; Yes, this is Wright.
My son stole a march on me, finding you. Here
he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob bent over the desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello....&rdquo; he said amid a tense silence.
&ldquo;Oh, did I guess right?... You didn&rsquo;t go on?
... set down in the cornfield ... fix it in the
morning?... Yes. Thank you, sir, for calling.
Yes, we just got here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replaced the receiver and turned to the
interested, expectant company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of the puzzles solved, and I guessed
rightly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Barney, when you suspected
the ex-pilot, I thought it might be that he&rsquo;d do
the same as he had done on the airplane I
piloted&mdash;Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s own sport craft. You
know why I had to set it down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;because the other man&mdash;Arthur&mdash;chased
you down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bob, slowly. &ldquo;You mentioned the
ex-pilot having access to the &lsquo;planes. Well, on
the brown ship&mdash;the wires were crossed tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Barney gasped, and recovered from
his startled amazement. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! That&rsquo;s
bad for&mdash;the ex-pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it disposes of one mystery&mdash;who! He
was probably there at The Windsock and heard
you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it. Well, now, that clears up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but one more puzzle,&rdquo; said Curt. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
getting away with the small parts, and valuable
instruments?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can settle that!&rdquo; said Barney. &ldquo;Sandy
Jim, the rigger Al was put to work for&mdash;remember
him sending you to his house with a lot
of parcels supposed to contain junk for his
kid?&rdquo; Al nodded, dismayed. It hurt to hear
that honest-looking Sandy was so wicked. But
Barney seemed to have the correct idea, as the
evidence indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll round them up tomorrow.&rdquo; Barney
rose. &ldquo;Suppose I take those books along with
me? I&rsquo;ll bring them in early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Bob jumped up, gathering the books.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Summer shower wetting the streets&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
wrap these in paper for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he returned with the parcel all goodnights
had been said and the party broke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright to Bob, &ldquo;what do you
think now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. He acted all right. But he always
has done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Al was sleepy but curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suspect Barney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you? He has helped us, and
he&rsquo;s Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s friend and I always thought&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;A criminal had to have a motive?&rdquo; prompted
his father. &ldquo;I attached no importance to one
fact I have discovered, until I felt sure of Barney&rsquo;s
guilt. Now I do. This might be his motive!
Years ago Mr. Tredway won the girl
whom another pilot was courting. The man went
from bad to worse, threatened&mdash;and then disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jealousy! Hate!&rdquo; gasped Curt. &ldquo;But Barney!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course that was not the pilot&rsquo;s name. He
must have changed his name as well as his appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Father, how did you know it&rsquo;s Barney.
How about the ex-pilot? Couldn&rsquo;t he?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Al. He worked for Mr. Tredway after
the latter married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;then&mdash;good cracky! Bob&mdash;you gave
the culprit all the evidence in those books&mdash;to
destroy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Bob smiled. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s encyclopedia is
shy four volumes, and there are three vitamine
books gone, and Barney has them. The real
books are in their places on our shelves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they did compliment him!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<h2 id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII
<br /><span class="small">FLIGHT!</span></h2>
<p>When the sun peered through dispersing
Summer storm clouds it saw three alert, wide-awake
youths, a little tired but very tense, in
the testing field of the Tredway aircraft plant.</p>
<p>With them were Mr. Tredway, the Chief of
Police, Mr. Parsons and Griff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Tredway&rsquo;s speed plane fueled up,&rdquo; Mr.
Wright came over from the offices where he had
deposited the company books in readiness for
later use: his question was addressed to Griff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, sir,&rdquo; the young son of Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s
partner responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All plans arranged, Chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a net spread that Barney Horton
couldn&rsquo;t escape if he was an eel. One of my best
detectives has been outside his house ever since
he went in from the taxi, at one &lsquo;a.m.&rsquo; Those
two men over by the offices, getting ready to dig
a trench, are two picked men of my headquarters
staff. Every motorcycle man, every traffic man,
all our roundsmen and policemen are on the
alert.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;I simply cannot believe it of Barney,&rdquo; Mr.
Tredway was as doleful as though they were
planning to arrest him, instead of his plant manager,
&ldquo;I took him in and gave him every opportunity,
taught him all he knows, pushed him
to the top. To think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hatred for a fancied wrong is a terrible
force for evil,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t look a bit like the man who
was trying to win the woman who became my
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; interrupted the Chief of Police,
&ldquo;she hasn&rsquo;t appeared at all in this&mdash;have you
separated? Isn&rsquo;t she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; quickly, &ldquo;she is alive. My wife
is away in Europe. That is the reason I decided
to&mdash;disappear. I knew that news of it would
not reach her before I &lsquo;came to life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Barney is the guilty man,&rdquo; Curt was
still dazed, &ldquo;why did he turn suspicion on that
ex-pilot at The Windsock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tried to turn suspicion on everybody,&rdquo;
retorted Mr. Wright. &ldquo;It is a favorite trick of
a guilty person. He has practically accused the
bookkeeper, the supply clerk, Sandy Jim, the
rigger and the man you mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s free,&rdquo; Al spoke. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you
arrest him while you had him at the house showing
him the books?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember one fact, my young
&lsquo;Sky Squadder,&rsquo;&rdquo; the Chief of Police commented.
&ldquo;Circumstantial evidence, and suspicion
are one thing. Proof of guilt that will
stand in court against a clever lawyer is something
quite different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; Mr. Wright explained, &ldquo;we
feel, with absolute conviction, that Barney is
our man. We haven&rsquo;t any actual proof. We
must wait until he makes some open move. Bob,
cleverly discovering Barney&rsquo;s supposed guilt
because he saw Barney make that excuse to get
out to the airplane when he said he wanted to
dismiss his taxi, did all he could to keep the
man close to his Sky Squad; but Barney was
clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he would make a try for the books
during the night if I got him to stay with us,&rdquo;
Bob admitted modestly. &ldquo;Then, when he refused
to spend the night with us I hoped he&rsquo;d
discover that we had substituted other books
for the ledgers, and would try to get in our
place to get all the incriminating evidence. But,&rdquo;
dejectedly, &ldquo;he was too clever for that, even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you expect him to make an open
move, if he&rsquo;s all that wise?&rdquo; asked Griff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mr. Wright spoke up, &ldquo;some one has
been quietly exchanging company stock, turning
some into gold, here and there. I think it
was Barney&rsquo;s work under assumed names, to
get his money into shape for escape. We have
made him see that we know how the cheap,
shoddy supplies are coming in, and other
things: he will try to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paying tellers of the town banks are on
the watch. The first minute he comes to close
his accounts, as he will do before he takes a
train, we will be informed. Before he goes he
may try to destroy the false account books, and
leave only conviction of his guilt, but no real,
legal proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Al was still somewhat puzzled. &ldquo;Bob,
how did you come to suspect Barney at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember me telling what was said
when I flew with Lang to see Father?&rdquo; As Al
and Curt nodded, Bob added, &ldquo;Barney used a
phrase about &lsquo;crossed wires.&rsquo; Then I found
crossed wires in Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s ship last night,
and later Mr. Tredway found wires chafed, and
led across each other, by his brown &lsquo;plane
carburetor. It was the quickest way to endanger
a ship&mdash;the spark could set fire to free gas, and
might not be noticed in daylight. Barney had
time to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he went out? I see,&rdquo; Curt said. &ldquo;But,
Bob, you thought some one was listening, watching&mdash;you
told Barney so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;I still think some one was spying over our
dinner&mdash;but it may have been the manager,
Jenks, who may be &lsquo;in&rsquo; with Barney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak of the&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Tredway gave a warning
glance as he began the old adage, &ldquo;speak of
the devil, he&rsquo;s sure to appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To their amazement, Barney came through
the gates. He was calm, quiet, not at all furtive
or frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the idea of that trick you played
with the books?&rdquo; He patted the package he carried.
Bob was confused.</p>
<p>The arrival of the rigger, Sandy Jim, coming
early to complete work on the new airplane
for which the owner was in such a hurry, enabled
Bob to hide his confusion as his father
answered, quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that, Barney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, who turned his head to hide his crimson
face, and who went to greet Sandy Jim, with
Al, as an excuse to avoid an explanation that
might upset their plans, was surprised at the
look on Sandy Jim&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The man was staring at Mr. Tredway as
though he saw a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;thought that man was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sandy!&rdquo; Al greeted, taking the
amazement as natural, since everyone around
the plant supposed the owner to have gone under
the mud in the Silver Flash, &ldquo;ready for
work early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yeah! How&rsquo;d he get here?&rdquo; He jerked
a thumb toward Mr. Tredway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a taxi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob took over the explanation, giving Sandy
enough of the former happenings to enable the
rigger to recover from his surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right glad,&rdquo; the man stated, finally.
&ldquo;Now&mdash;Al, you get some of your crowd together
and fuel up this new crate&mdash;soon as a pilot
shows up we want it tested. I may have to make
some changes in the wire tension and balance&mdash;get
busy, me lads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al eagerly agreed, seeing that their carefully
planned &ldquo;coup&rdquo; had fallen through. Barney,
listening to Mr. Wright, to Mr. Tredway, to the
latter&rsquo;s partner and the Chief of Police, trying,
all together, to give him a &ldquo;third degree,&rdquo; began
to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo; He threw back his head,
roaring his mirth. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m the culprit, eh? Ho-ho!
Oh, my, that&rsquo;s rich. Clever Sky Squad
you have, Wright! Ha-ha-ha-ho-ho! Here I
am doing all I can to help my partner, trying to
solve the puzzles he couldn&rsquo;t untangle&mdash;and I&rsquo;m
to be arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one spoke of arrest!&rdquo; the Police Chief
hedged. &ldquo;Are you sending some one else to get
your banked gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banked gold?&rdquo; Barney dropped his jaw as
the question was shot at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Converting stock!&rdquo; snapped Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>Barney stared and then smiled. &ldquo;All the stock
I ever had is in my safe deposit box&mdash;come on!
I&rsquo;ll show you, at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were puzzled. Arthur Tredway was
eager to claim that his friend and protege was
innocent.</p>
<p>The others were compelled to admit as Bob
mentally decided, that Barney&rsquo;s face, manner
and actions were open and honest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough gas,&rdquo; said the rigger. &ldquo;Now,
Al, fill her up with oil&mdash;I want to see Mr. Tredway.&rdquo;
He descended from the aircraft, went
to his employer and with many protestations of
delight gripped his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;Mr. Tredway, this
crate they&rsquo;re fueling is in a big rush. I have
to make adjustments for balance before she is
delivered. Can&rsquo;t you take her up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Mr. Tredway was anxious to get
into action since he had agreed to &ldquo;return to
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey&mdash;Bob&mdash;got her filled? Warm her up
for Mr. Tredway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>Bob nodded, consulted the brand new instruments
and noted that the fuel and oil registered
at &ldquo;full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas on&mdash;switch off,&rdquo; he told Al. &ldquo;Whirl
that prop, Al.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brother did his bidding. It took several
trials to start the new engine but Bob got it
going and then drew back the throttle to idling
speed and went over to rejoin the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Arthur ought to take that crate
up,&rdquo; Barney was half laughing. &ldquo;Of course I
know that the only wires I ever crossed was
when I flew my crates over telegraph lines&mdash;but
he might think I had &rsquo;em crossed in this ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Tredway laid a hand on his protege&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>But Bob was not watching Barney.</p>
<p>His eyes were fixed on Sandy Jim, and he
beckoned to his father.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, rapidly, Bob spoke to his father.
The detective nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the speedster of Mr. Tredway&rsquo;s
warmed up, too,&rdquo; Bob said softly, &ldquo;in case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Al&rsquo;s amazement and Curt&rsquo;s astonishment
the head of the Sky Squad beckoned furiously.
They followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if there&rsquo;s gas and oil in this,&rdquo; he urged
as he led them to the ship he had flown the night
before, returned to its field by Mr. Parsons.
&ldquo;Listen, fellows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>As he busied himself making ready to start
the motor, getting the nose of the sport &lsquo;plane
into the wind, Bob explained.</p>
<p>What he said startled his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While Mr. Tredway was joking Barney
about the crossed wires, did you see Jim&rsquo;s
face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rigger?&rdquo; Al exclaimed, &ldquo;you mean&mdash;when
he got white?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Listen&mdash;gas off, switch on. Give her
a spin, Curt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the engine took up its roar, he clambered
in again, leaned far over the edge to Curt, while
Al climbed into the after seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy Jim turned white,&rdquo; he said above the
engine hum. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve found the real&mdash;watch,
fellows! Father is going to tell Barney
in front of Sandy Jim about the crossed wires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim is acting nervous,&rdquo; added Curt. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
turning&mdash;the chief has grabbed his arm. Now
Dad is going to say to Barney that he&rsquo;s guilty,
that he hates his benefactor because of the
other man winning Barney&rsquo;s girl&mdash;of course we
know it&rsquo;s Jim, now&mdash;watch him! Jim&rsquo;s being
accused now&mdash;look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baffled, his face displaying his guilt, Sandy
Jim fled to the new airplane.</p>
<p>Without an instant of delay Bob widened the
throttle opening!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<h2 id="c33">CHAPTER XXXIII
<br /><span class="small">THE SKY SQUAD WINS</span></h2>
<p>Roaring across the runway, Bob&rsquo;s one purpose
was to use the airplane as a missile, to run
it into the other before Sandy Jim could rise.
In that he failed. The other ship was up, and
Bob knew that he had so much speed that he
must take off or ram into a hangar.</p>
<p>By a spurt of the cold engine, risking a stall
to get his trucks over the hangar, Bob soared.</p>
<p>Leveling off, he glanced around. To his
amazement he saw Al snapping on his safety
belt in the rear cockpit seat. Al waved a hand,
pointing to one side. And Bob looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s having trouble,&rdquo; Al screamed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
working on something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob began to climb. If he could force Jim to
earth as he had been herded the night before&mdash;</p>
<p>Jim saw his move, and with a demon&rsquo;s venom
drew a weapon and began to fire.</p>
<p>But Bob sideslipped, dropped steeply into a
dive to come out of the slip, and as he drew
the ship to level flight, heard something strike
the prop, saw it shatter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>Jim had flung the metal gun so that the airplane
ran into it.</p>
<p>Bob began to look for a way to spiral back
to the testing field. His propeller, with a blade
shattered, was useless.</p>
<p>Al screeched again. To the west, coming
fast, was a ship they both recognized. Lang
was returning in Griff&rsquo;s speedster. Also, as Al
pointed out, the cabin &lsquo;plane was rising from
the landing field.</p>
<p>Al was so excited that he waggled the stick.</p>
<p>Then Bob saw!</p>
<p>Forestalled by the approach of Lang, with
the other ship rising to chase, with his engine
functioning badly, and the resulting distraction
of attention, Jim&rsquo;s safety was endangered.</p>
<p>The very thing that he had done when he
planned to urge Mr. Tredway to test the
&lsquo;plane&mdash;crossing two wires&mdash;had prevented his
escape.</p>
<p>The new carburetor, leaking, dripped a rich
gas and air mixture onto the sparking wires&mdash;there
was a flash of flames as Bob looked.</p>
<p>Almost he forgot his own purpose, but with
steeled will he held his tight spiral, saw the
cabin ship was out of his way, shot the field,
and landed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>When Lang and the others joined him beside
the smoking ruins of the new ship, they saw
Sandy Jim, who had tried to escape by jumping
before the flames reached him.</p>
<p>Wrenched, broken, bruised, he was still able
to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come through, Jim&mdash;what&rsquo;s the truth?&rdquo;
asked the Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hated Tredway from the time he got the
girl I wanted to marry,&rdquo; Jim panted, as they
gave him water. &ldquo;I went from bad to worse&mdash;went
to the dogs. I got in with tough men,
tried prize-fighting, that&rsquo;s how my face got
changed, so I wasn&rsquo;t easy to remember and
recognize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laid low for a while, then I gave up plans
for revenge, and decided to come to work here
to be close to the woman I loved, only, last Fall,
she went away. So I knew Tredway had drove
her to separate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy! My wife went to Europe for
a long visit with relatives in France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest? Then all my hate was on a wrong
idea. Well, you know most of the rest. I
damaged ships, worked with the bookkeeper and
the supply clerk and a manager of The Windsock
to substitute cheap stuff for good, sell the
good and ruin the plant&mdash;but it was all no use&mdash;and
started on a wrong idea&mdash;no use to say
I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;but&mdash;well, boys, handle me easy&mdash;I&rsquo;m
no good, but I can feel pain!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>In that fashion the culprit confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sorry for Jimmy-junior, and the
man&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said Curt, after the ambulance
had taken Sandy Jim to the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy-junior isn&rsquo;t his son,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Parsons. &ldquo;He is the son of Sandy&rsquo;s brother,
whom Jim took to raise. It would be a good
idea if you young men took him into the Sky
Squad now, to take his mind off his sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw his mother and I thought she
was Jim&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s Jimmy-junior&rsquo;s mother, but
Sandy&rsquo;s sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; urged Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
about time to wake up our new member.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
